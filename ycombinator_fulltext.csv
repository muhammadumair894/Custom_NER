"LanceDB 🍢 - serverless, low-latency vector database for AI applications","🙋 Are you building a generative AI app using an LLM or API? Are you working on a new recsys, a modern search engine, or a new analytical tool for unstructured data? Good news: you no longer have to struggle with Pinecone’s high cost, over the top complexity, or data privacy concerns. 🚀 [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) is a free and open-source vector database that you can run locally or on your own server. It’s lightning fast and is easy to embed into your backend server. Check out our [github repo](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) or pip install lancedb to get started. For a quick demo, you can take a look at our sample [youtube transcript search app](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb/blob/main/notebooks/youtube_transcript_search.ipynb). We’ll be adding a lot more soon. For more details on the API, take a look at [LanceDB docs](https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/). ![](https://lancedb.com/images/eto-splash-arrow.png) ### **❓ Why we built LanceDB** As we spoke to builders of ML/AI applications, a common refrain from users was struggling to get services like Pinecone even running. After a while, we realized that the retrieve-filter-hydrate workflow was often time a big bottleneck in productivity and app latency. So we put our heads together. I was one of the original co-authors of the pandas library. Lei was a core-contributor to HDFS and led ML infrastructure at Cruise. Using our experience building data/ML tooling, we’ve built something totally new. ![uploaded image](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/media/?key=user_uploads/858308/435bcc86-88ef-4c62-9f14-ba9d84c5c48f) ### **LanceDB ❤️ builders** We’ve reimagined vector search from the ground up for better developer productivity, scalability, and performance. LanceDB is backed by [Lance format](https://github.com/eto-ai/lance) — a modern columnar data format that is an alternative to parquet. It’s optimized for high speed random access and management of AI datasets like vectors, documents, and images. We then added our own Rust implementations of a number of SOTA ANN-index algorithms to support low-latency vector search. These indices are SSD-based and can easily scale wayyyy beyond memory. What’s more, LanceDB allows you to store and filter other features along with vectors. Our users have been able to replace 3–4 different data stores with LanceDB alone and achieve a speedup at the same time. ### **🛣️ Roadmap** Since our launch, the community has added LangChain support. Our integration for LlamaIndex is also under review. Our current focus is building a TypeScript implementation with a native-level experience.  Currently, we provide a python package called lancedb which is pip installable and delivers a great local workflow. Beyond what we’re working on right now, here’s what you can expect: * Ecosystem **integrations** into OpenAI plugin / AutoGPT etc * Richer set of **embedding functions** and **document processing** conveniences * **Gallery** of generative AI apps powered by LanceDB * Solutions for **cloud** deployment ### **🙏 How to get started** To get started with LanceDB head over to our [repo](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb). If you have questions, feedback, or want help using LanceDB in your app, don’t hesitate to drop us a line at [contact@lancedb.com](mailto:contact@lancedb.com).",Chang She,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/7fac6d13a6e767ce791580c1200cbdaaa236d900.jpg,Otherimage_25561_1.jpg;,25561

Hatchways - Making engineering interviewing look more like real work,"**TL;DR:** Easily customize GitHub-based technical assessments, where candidates can complete tasks like reviewing code, submitting a pull request, or improving a system’s design. Hatchways helps you build a state-of-the-art practical interview process that is customized to your role while saving you engineering interview load along the way. # 👋 The Origin Story I've shared my personal struggle with traditional interviews on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20578850) and how I’ve never been great at \""performing\"" on the spot. This summarizes well what our mission has always been: _“Mainstream hiring processes are biased towards those who went to great schools, had high GPAs, are native-English speaking, have worked at brand name companies, are extroverts and great networkers, etc. But there are so many talented people who don't fit that profile. We're excited to work on ways of hiring that give them a better chance.”_ Over time, we realized the challenge in solving this issue lies in the fact that companies lack incentives to improve their processes unless it saves them money or time. Thus, Hatchways is on a mission to make talent discovery efficient yet fair. By streamlining skill evaluations, we help companies save time while hiring top talent with the right skills for the job, rather than focusing on pedigree, connections, or interview prowess. # 🤔**The Problem: Inefficient Interviewing** Many companies struggle with inefficient interviewing— spending too much time while not getting quality signal. Although creating a unique process is time-consuming, mimicking FAANG approaches, which most companies do, leads to inaccurate signal, a lot of wasted engineering hours, and increased competition for the same talent pool. # 💡**The Solution: Design a Purposeful Interview Experience** Hatchways enables you to develop an effective interview process, ensuring accurate signal capture, time savings for engineers, and a positive candidate experience. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=71240&key=user_uploads/321746/b44f8b5f-fbf0-4990-a37e-67afc3768fc5) # 🦄 **How it works:** * **Adopt Best Practices from Leading Tech Companies, and Tailor to your Needs:** We've distilled best practices from tech leaders at Dropbox, Plaid, and Airtable (e.g., crafting rubrics, enhancing candidate experience, setting pass-through rates) and can easily customize them for your company, role, and specific hiring needs. * **Custom Rubrics and Tailored Interview Questions:** Most companies introduce interviewing rubrics too late. This leads to standardization and bias issues, resulting in inconsistent hiring outcomes. We assist in identifying crucial skills and transforming them into a grading rubric to shape the perfect interview question. * **Streamline Grading and Optimize Calibration Effortlessly:** With Hatchways, use our automation features to build test cases or utilize our human-assisted reviewers to reduce your engineering review load. Drawing from the best practices of leading technical teams, we establish a starting benchmark and optimize your on-site pass-through rates over time. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=71240&key=user_uploads/321746/d2286ba9-dc3f-4647-b835-7b4faf858137) ### **Use Cases** What companies use Hatchways for: * pre-screen technical assessment (i.e. resume replacement) * technical phone-screen step (i.e. 60-90 minute live coding replacement) * university/intern recruiting (i.e. high-volume vetting) Who is this for? * Companies scaling engineering hiring who are aiming to reduce interviewer load * Companies aiming to introduce greater standardization in their interview process # **Asks** * If you’re an engineer who wants to see companies adopt more effective and fair interviewing practices - share this with them * For companies aiming to streamline their interview process while ensuring a fair and enjoyable candidate experience, sign up on our platform [here](https://www.hatchways.io/?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=launch_yc) or reach out directly to me to learn more: [jaclyn@hatchways.io](mailto:jaclyn@hatchways.io)",Jaclyn Ling,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/154cbe9486c0ec21779685f3c1c125cda5ff8f5b.jpg,Otherimage_12659_1.jpg;Otherimage_12659_2.jpg;,12659

Motörhead - LLM memory server built in Rust,"## Overview [Motörhead](https://github.com/getmetal/motorhead) is an open-source memory and information retrieval server for LLMs. Built and supported by [Metal](https://getmetal.io/). As LLM usage becomes more widely adopted, modern software products must handle users' LLM interactions, chat sessions, and retrieval for relevant prompting context at scale. With much of the performance cost being on the prompting to APIs like OpenAI and other LLMs, contextual data retrieval is ideally as fast as possible. ## Features * 🪄 Modern strategies to stay within the prompt window * 💬 Chat session management out of the box * 🦜 [Langchain integration](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory/examples/motorhead_memory.html) * 🧠 Automatic Embedding generation via OpenAI ADA * 🕸️ Redis Vector DB forto utilize RedisSearch (semantic) * 💽 Short-term & long-term storage * 🔥 Built in Rust for performance ## Roadmap * User Authentication * Knowledge Graph Memory handling * Additional support for other Embedding Models * [Create an issue!](https://github.com/getmetal/motorhead/issues) ## Resources * Check out [Motörhead on Github](https://github.com/getmetal/motorhead) * Join the [Motörhead Discord](https://discord.gg/sxbFX5dsQY) * Suggest a [feature for Motörhead](https://github.com/getmetal/motorhead/issues)",James O'Dwyer,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/5b49b1a7c0a4781597e822e509086005f86747ad.jpg,,28183
Tarsal: Data pipeline built for modern security teams,"### **TL;DR:** [**Tarsal**](https://tarsal.co) **is the first data pipeline built for modern security teams.** We’re like Fivetran or Segment, but built for security teams. Tarsal provides: \\- one-click ingestion and normalization for all security logs (e.g multi-cloud infra, Okta, Duo, Slack, CrowdStrike, etc.) \\- normalization _across_ sources for easy correlation \\- detections as code \\- a vendor-agnostic pipeline so you can use the best log destination for the job (supported destinations include Snowflake, S3, Databricks, Splunk, DataDog, etc.)   ### 👤 **The Team** [**Sunny Rekhi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunny-rekhi/) **(CEO)** was previously an infrastructure + backend engineer at TikTok and Uber, where he worked on high scale data systems. [**Manny Gundampalli**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manny-gundampalli-6a982019b/) **(CTO)** was previously a data infrastructure engineer at Plaid, where she worked on Plaid’s highest volume ML pipelines. ### **❌ The Problem** **Security data has become unmanageable.** ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/48OpE_QVew8YK5ESoSSTbQC9_FXZWfbtePb8yXmZlY7vpDTBGjNbqb7rCW4XRM4BzJtnUng2CeOGYkrqzO3VHXonj_23Q99TUIGRqOHDqZxNC7RdXz-W1sBM78XNig5TovQL1n5S8TtaeKgVdII8W2AtGQ=nw) * There’s no standard for how security data is defined, so security teams have to write complex queries to account for all the variations. * There’s no consistent way to get your log data: some vendors expose a REST API, others expose a GraphQL API. Some give you JSON data, some give you unstructured text. Schematized data is rare. * There’s _a lot_ of it. Security data is growing at 23% CAGR, and log storage costs are incredibly high. ## **✨ Our Solution** [**Tarsal**](https://tarsal.co) is the first data pipeline built for modern security teams. With zero-hassle, one-click connectors, security teams can ingest normalized data and route it to the destination of their choice. **Our unified schema is specifically designed to reduce the complexity in incident response.** By normalizing a set of standard fields across all log sources, security teams no longer have to write complex queries to track an incident across their systems. Query once against Tarsal fields — let us figure out how that maps back to the original data. **We save you money on log storage costs by letting you route logs to the cheapest destination.** With data growing 23% year over year, organizations face ballooning infrastructure cost. Tarsal lets you filter + route logs to any of our supported destinations, including major SIEMs, Amazon S3, or a modern data warehouse like Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks. **Tarsal lets you write real-time detections as code.** Write expressive and flexible detections in Python for needs specific to your enterprise.

Zidisha - Crowdfunding for developing country entrepreneurs,"TL;DR: Fund a small business for a low-income entrepreneur in Africa or Asia. Interact directly with your chosen entrepreneur via chat, photos and videos. Then watch your impact multiply as the entrepreneur pays your donation forward by funding other entrepreneurs in need. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=71010&key=user_uploads/36608/a2a1c289-4c12-44b5-9559-68e075dd0a1d) ### The problem: Developing country businesses lack capital Small businesses provide 80% of employment in Africa and other emerging markets - but they lack access to the capital they need to grow and provide more jobs. Too small to be profitable for banks and too large to benefit from consumer loan apps, these businesses are called the “missing middle” because they fall between the tiers served by existing financial infrastructure. For example, Daniel started a cybercafe in a low-income neighborhood in Ghana. His facility is the only source of internet access in the community, but it has only two computers and people must wait for hours to use them. Daniel earns barely enough to support his family, and there isn’t enough left over to invest in new machines. ### The solution: Connecting entrepreneurs to investment capital A friend invites Daniel to use Zidisha, and he signs up and posts his story and photos on the platform. His initial project of $50 is funded by a combination of Zidisha entrepreneurs and philanthropic backers who visit the website. He uses the $50 to buy a printer and add printing services to his cybercafe. Within a couple of months, the printer has paid for itself. Daniel “pays it forward” by funding $50 worth of projects for other fundraising entrepreneurs on the platform. In a subsequent project, Daniel raises $300 and uses it to acquire two more second-hand computers. This doubles the capacity of his cybercafe and Daniel’s earnings. Daniel pays the $300 forward to other Zidisha entrepreneurs while continuing to benefit from the increased cash flow. The increased earnings allow Daniel to enroll his daughter in high school. Eventually, Daniel raises $1000 to open a second cybercafe in a nearby neighborhood. He hires two employees to help him manage the second cybercafe. ### How it works Entrepreneurs in developing countries create project pages where they share their story, photos, and descriptions of their investment opportunity. Projects are funded by backers from all over the world. Instead of repaying the projects as loans, entrepreneurs “pay it forward” by in turn funding other entrepreneurs on the platform. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=71010&key=user_uploads/36608/bd8803ee-5359-4009-8d63-e66a4c4fe466) Entrepreneurs post project updates and interact directly with their backers through the project discussion tab. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=71010&key=user_uploads/36608/e1786735-029d-492b-b38c-6cafcec477d9) Backers can view which projects were funded by their entrepreneurs and watch their impact grow over time as the funds continue to be recycled. ### How you can help * Connect us with impact investors who are interested in creating new opportunities in developing countries.

Swifteam - Mobile Device Management (MDM) with global Zero Touch Deployment (ZTD),"### **⛔️The problem** In 2020, **the global workforce** adapted to **remote work**. Since then, the way remote companies are managed is constantly evolving too. It used to be that you had to **manually order, set up, and ship** new computers and accessories to new remote hires. **Huge pain** – especially when it was time to retrieve your devices, offboard employees, or even worse – keep company data safe if a device was stolen or lost. ### **🚀The solution** So we built **Swifteam – Mobile Device Management (MDM) software** to supply, secure, and support your remote team. Swifteam solves device management problems for remote teams, so you don’t spend days setting up new employees. You can buy devices, deliver them, and relocate them; blazingly fast – **all from one app**. Swifteam integrates with 25 HR systems. Connecting your HR and IT asset dashboards lets you manage devices, agreements, uptime, lock, and wipe – quickly and securely.

🏗️ 1build - Plaid for construction cost data,"**TL;DR: 1build is launching the API for construction pricing data. Developers can use our API to access up-to-date information on construction costs for workflows like construction estimating, procurement, and loan/insurance underwriting. The API can be either queried with GraphQL or easily integrated into any application with one line of HTML.** ﻿📚﻿ **Backstory** As wild as it sounds, the construction industry still uses actual books that are published once a year to track construction market pricing. I previously ran the data science team at CloudKitchens where I needed an API for tracking live construction pricing data--but instead of an API I had to deal with these cost books. ![](https://t4207102.p.clickup-attachments.com/t4207102/24e83b10-e8f3-4b04-b043-a050c01c2eb1/image.png) ﻿📊﻿ **Problem** Construction costs have been extremely volatile over the last several years. For example, lumber prices skyrocketed 400% and then crashed in 2021. At the same time, the construction tech space is booming ($5B+ is invested annually), but it still lacks its own \""Plaid\"" for mission-critical market pricing data. ﻿🛠️﻿ **Our solution** 1build has an easy-to-use API as well as a JavaScript embed widget that gives you access to live pricing data on 68 million construction materials, labor, and equipment anywhere in the US. ﻿🚀﻿ **How it works** You can either use our GraphQL API ([docs](https://developer.1build.com/1build-api-reference)) or JavaScript embed widget ([docs](https://developer.1build.com/1build-widget-reference/)) to integrate construction pricing data into your application.

Nirva: Redefining chronic disease management,"### **The Chronic illness crisis - Now or Never❌** A chronic condition is a long-term health issue like diabetes, Arthritis, etc.. that doesn’t have a complete cure. The only way to deal with them is to cultivate sustainable dietary and lifestyle habits. Chronic conditions have always been on the rise due to changing lifestyles, dietary habits, and environmental factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has only served to intensify this alarming trend, catapulting it to new heights. To put it in perspective, Today more than **70%** of the adult population in the US report having one or more long-term health conditions that impact their quality of life and this number is rising.\\ \\ _Chronic illnesses account for **75% of all healthcare expenses** in the US._ Although genetics play a role, most chronic illnesses are influenced by social determinants of health, such as sleep, diet, fitness, and stress. The power to make a difference lies largely with the individual. In order to solve this problem, we need to shift the agency. So far the agents of healthcare have been doctors, nurses, and paramedics and the venue of healthcare has been hospitals and clinics and this needs to shift. The agent has to be the individual themselves and the venue has to be wherever the individual is, the home, their office, or wherever else. ### **What’s the problem with Chronic condition management now?** I’ll walk you through the problems of the existing approach through the **story of our client👩🏻** Jennifer who is a lawyer in London. She has a busy life and started experiencing peri-menopause symptoms like gut issues and hot flashes at 50. She took medication but they only gave her temporary relief. The symptoms kept on coming back and this affected her family and work life causing a lot of stress for her. Her mental health took a toll and that impacted her physical health. She became trapped in a vicious flywheel, where her declining mental health fueled her physical deterioration, and vice versa. ### **Our Solution✅** Jennifer joined our program. She received personalized Ayurvedic diet plans based on her body type. Through the program, she learned healthy diet habits and how to eat food in the right way, discovering the power of food as medicine. Jennifer had a dedicated health coach who kept her motivated and supported her throughout her healing journey. She also did 1-1 therapeutic yoga sessions that were tailor-made for her condition. These sessions not only provided physical exercise but also helped her calm down in a way that a normal yoga session wouldn't. In addition to this, Jennifer had access to a community of supportive women who were going through the same phase as her, creating a sense of belonging and support. Our Nirva app helped Jennifer stay accountable to her goals through customized progress tracking. The app provided her with a gamified healing experience and helped her build sustainable dietary and lifestyle habits. With consistent effort, Jennifer's symptoms subsided within just 3 months. She gained control over her health and her life, and we couldn't be happier to have been a part of her journey. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70803&key=user_uploads/528396/b0c71ae2-86ee-4d8c-8052-dd8c006a85ad) Our customer love is Insane-Don’t have to take our word for it.

Semantic Finance: Real-time AI-powered financial news data,"TL;DR: Semantic provides financial institutions a real-time news insights API for events that affect the financial markets. We use trade data, articles, social media engagement data, and breakthroughs in language models to filter the 99% of noise faster than the markets can react. — --- Hey YC, we’re Josh and Akhil, and we’re building Semantic. Josh (CEO) met Akhil (CTO) in high school and share a similar interest in how underutilized qualitative data is in financial markets. We reconnected after a combined 7 years of experience in Software Engineering at companies such as Google, IBM, Squarespace, and Charles Schwab. We’ve been studying how news impacts markets from a quantitative standpoint independently for years. Joshua developed an event-based trading algorithm that Ematiq proposed to implement during his time at Google. ### **The Problem** \\ As trading firms spend tens of millions on microwave networks, racing for the fastest market data and order execution, GPT-4 has introduced a new race for relevant financial information retrieval and processing. Existing news feeds are too slow, unactionable, and noisy. They provide no additional information or filtering on the context, urgency, and market impact. ### **The Solution** \\ We provide a novel insights layer on top of aggregated news and social media feeds, leveraging breakthroughs in LLMs’ (large language models) incredible semantic understanding of text to structure and automatically find the news that matters. We monitor clustered mentions across multiple sources, engagement metrics over time, and anomalous price/volume changes to determine the market impact of events in real-time.

Sensible Biotechnologies: Engineering cells to make better mRNA 🧬,"At Sensible Bio, we are turning living cells into cost-efficient factories for manufacturing high-quality mRNA to unlock the full potential of mRNA therapeutics and vaccines. ### **tl;dr** Messenger RNA (mRNA) is a promising biological platform for both vaccines and therapeutics. Today, all mRNA is synthesised via cell-free processes, which are expensive, cumbersome, and cannot produce mRNA with sufficient quality for many of its promising clinical applications. **We engineer cells to produce high-quality mRNA in a scalable and cost-efficient fashion to meet the growing demand for mRNA in novel vaccines and therapies.** ### **The Problem: Cell-free mRNA manufacturing** Currently, mRNA production completely relies on In Vitro Transcription (IVT), a cell-free process involving numerous proprietary and expensive enzymes and reagents. This method also requires multiple intricate steps, laborious purification procedures, and cannot be scaled to large reaction volumes. Importantly, IVT-based mRNA manufacturing generates highly immunogenic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which is posing risks in some of the most important applications of mRNA such as in gene editing and cancer. Moreover, it is difficult to produce and purify long mRNA sequences via IVT; this creates major obstacles for other promising mRNA modalities like self-amplifying mRNAs, which could significantly reduce the high amounts of mRNA needed for many of its therapeutic applications. **To truly unleash the power of mRNA more efficient, affordable, and effective mRNA manufacturing methods are needed.** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70713&key=user_uploads/89898/0eb9ee01-1c73-46bd-b15f-3bc3376e2176) ## **The Solution: Cell-free mRNA manufacturing (not done)** **We are utilizing the processes in the living cells, which have been producing high-quality mRNA for millions of years.** By combining natural cellular processes with cell engineering, we build a scalable platform to produce high-quality mRNA cost-effectively. Our platform enables the production of **longer mRNA**, while addressing the problem of **immunogenic double-stranded RNA** inherent in IVT. By removing the need for expensive and proprietary reagents, we enable **cost-effective mRNA manufacturing** and improve access to mRNA technology. Also, the **scalability** of cell-based mRNA production strengthens biosecurity and supply chain resilience. Our objective is to become a partner for all pharma and biotech companies striving to produce the next generation of mRNA therapies and vaccines. ## **The Platform** Our platform combines the principles of **cell engineering**, **computational** **biology** and **precision** **fermentation**. We exploit and optimise the selective packaging of the mRNA of interest into specific protein complexes. This enables a specific encapsulation of mRNA, prevents mRNA contamination and simplifies its downstream processing. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70713&key=user_uploads/89898/01d827a8-d966-4616-a155-5a029401da1d) ## **Team** Sensible Bio was founded in August 2021 by **Miroslav Gasparek** (CEO) and **Dr Marian Kupculak** (CSO). **Miro** holds a Bioengineering degree from Imperial College London and conducted research at Imperial College, Caltech and Stanford.

Squack - Natural language RPA tools for accountants,"tl;dr: We squash the learning curve for RPA tools by enabling users to create and fine-tune automations with plain language. For example, a bookkeeper with no coding experience can use Squack to create a workflow that processes a bank ledger and automatically categorizes transactions in only a few sentences. — Hey YC, we’re Preston, Eitan, and Eli, and we’re building Squack. We’re three longtime college friends who lived in the same house at Caltech (all from Ruddock (now Venerable) house). Preston and Eitan were snatched out of Physics & ML PhD’s, respectively, and Eli is an ex-Google engineer that loves automation. We live in a three floor house in the Mission with two cats, Fushi and Thea, five shrimp, and three snails. ### **The problem** Accountants work with large amounts of financial data that need to be processed accurately and efficiently. No-code tools like Alteryx designed to automate this work cost companies $6k/year per license, but only have a 5% utilization rate in a typical org. These graphical programming interfaces meant to make data processing accessible to non-technical employees end up being harder to learn than traditional code. It's so bad that we've heard stories of new associates who deliberately delete these RPA programs off of their computers the instant the \""training\"" is over. For example, this is what an Alteryx workflow looks like for computing the capital gains tax of a home: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70681&key=user_uploads/1187298/69747295-cd23-4f67-aac5-f20a23ced1eb) That's needlessly complicated! As a result, accountants find themselves over-utilizing brute force labor from off-shore teams to make deadlines during their busy seasons. Even the RPA experts would rather create an instruction document for these teams instead of rifling through stockpiles of old automations that need to be fine-tuned for the new task at hand. Using off-shore labor isn't an ideal alternative either. Even without the monetary costs, working with these teams means: * Inconvenient work schedules due to time zone differences. * Explaining document/video instructions over and over. * Carefully reviewing and correcting errors. ### **Our solution** Squack makes it feel like you're having a conversation with an RPA wizard that's helping you build out your automations. Instead of sending a large instruction document to an offshore team, you can just put those instructions into Squack and get the tool you need. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70681&key=user_uploads/1187298/a50ba384-b1bd-4407-a42a-ecb0da4fe297) Our LLM-based tool can: * Translate data processing instructions into a concise step-by-step procedure. * Wield powerful python packages like pandas to implement the procedure. * Dynamically generate new automations and modify old ones via natural language requests. * Perform other LLM tasks like categorization, data restructuring, and OCR. The flexibility of the large language model approach makes it perfect for handling the slight variations in accounting workflows from different clients. ### **Our ask** We're looking for referrals to accountants who work with RPA tools or outsourced teams to manage their data workflow. Some examples: * Audit, forensic, and tax strategy accounting * Outsourced labor agencies * Bookkeeping firms We're starting by building out tool workflows for small accounting firms, but we are generally interested speaking to anyone struggling with large-scale, repetitive tasks.

[Swishjam](https://www.swishjam.com) is a suite of [open-source](https://www.github.com/swishjam/swishjam) tools that enables companies to deliver the best experience to their users by providing them with the tools they need to measure, monitor, and optimize their page speed. **Page speed really, really matters** Page speed is one of the most important yet overlooked metrics to delivering the best experience to _all_ of your users. A faster page load is directly correlated with higher conversion, better SEO, and lower bounce rates. Amazon reported in 2006 that every additional 100ms in page load resulted in a 1% drop in revenue. Despite that, the page speed tooling is lagging behind, leaving users with more questions than answers. We first encountered this problem when working with users in a past role watching them attempt to diagnose performance issues on their site. While page speed was a top priority for them, they often had to use legacy software, and/or hire expensive consultants to triage and resolve them. **A wholistic solution to measuring, monitoring, and optimizing page speed** Swishjam helps you identify page speed bottlenecks by capturing key performance metrics your users are receiving on your site. Our dashboards help you make sense of your overall page speed, and provides you with actionable insights and tooling to improve. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70623&key=user_uploads/622150/fba9b8fe-a743-4318-abdd-79efe6954328) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70623&key=user_uploads/622150/4bebf3e3-89f4-466d-95db-391c1359feae) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70623&key=user_uploads/622150/1319cc5c-129a-4663-b194-61fc999f5da4) **Want to learn more?** If you or someone you know works in eCommerce, digital media, or a related industry where page speed is important KPI, we’d love any intros!

"Theya: World's simplest Bitcoin multi-sig, self-custody app","### **Tl:dr** Theya is the world’s simplest Bitcoin self-custody app for whole-coiners (users with >1BTC) who find crypto exchanges risky and hardware wallets overwhelming. We simplify the self-custody UX through our multi-device, multi-sig wallet that users can set up using smartphones, giving you the functionality and convenience of centralized exchanges without sacrificing control and security of hardware wallets. ### **Team** Vikas, Sriram and Smeet have extensive background in founding and scaling tech companies and crypto platforms over the past 10 years. Founders have been friends for over 15 years. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1235724/1abfbd7f-b023-47b1-8c54-ddf9bd32371f) Vikas was previously the co-founder and CTO of Porter, India’s largest intra-city logistics marketplace that does over $220M in annual revenue. He raised over $150M from Sequoia Capital and Tiger Global during his 7 years at Porter. While studying at Stanford, Vikas founded an ML-driven real estate fund that has invested over $30M. Sriram has led crypto engineering teams at Robinhood, FalconX and GameStop Blockchain. He built crypto custody infra and led the development of self-custody wallets for Robinhood and GameStop. He started his career at Google and has over 10 years of experience building consumer apps. Sriram graduated with Bachelors in Computer Science from IIT Bombay. Smeet has led marketing and go-to-market teams at multiple early-stage startups. Prior to Theya, he was the first business hire at Prodigal (YC S18). He started his career at Deutsche Bank and has 8+ years of experience trading macro assets like FX, Bonds, Equities and believes that long Bitcoin is the most important trade of the 2020s. ### **Problem:** The protection of your wealth and trust is paramount, which is why we exist. The reality is that centralized crypto platforms like FTX, Celsius, and Voyager have failed to ensure the safety of their users' Bitcoin. More recently, there are renewed concerns about Binance. As the saying goes, **\""not your keys, not your Bitcoin\""** and this is more true now than ever before. Every user who stores Bitcoin on popular crypto exchanges faces severe counterparty risks, including: **Credit Risk:** If your crypto exchange was to go bankrupt (like FTX) or suffer a catastrophic event, your Bitcoin stored there is certainly at risk. **Regulatory Risk:** Any change in laws or regulations, crypto exchanges may be forced to freeze or confiscate your Bitcoin. **Cybersecurity Risk:** While centralized exchanges invest in security measures, they are prime targets for cyber attacks. Successful hackers can steal users’ Bitcoin from hot wallets. Self-custody hardware wallets are a solution, but they come with their own set of challenges. They have a messy user experience, and users are responsible for managing their own setup, security, and backup keys. Furthermore, they represent a single point of failure. These risks make it crucial to prioritize the protection of your Bitcoin, and we are here to help you do just that. ### **Solution:** Our multisig wallet is like a digital safe where you need multiple keys to unlock it. For example, our 2-of-3 multi-sig wallet requires two out of three keys to approve a transaction before the Bitcoin can be spent. Customers will always hold the two keys necessary to approve transactions. Theya holds the third key that can only be used for recovery if you misplace one of your keys, but it can never be used to transfer funds on its own. Theya is simplifying the self-custody experience through a mobile-first multisig wallet that families can set up using iPhones and Apple Watches. We also support other devices such as NFC cards, hardware wallets, and more that can be used as your additional keys if desired. We make your Bitcoin resilient to phishing and hacking and you retain control of your Bitcoin wealth even if we fail without notice. ### **Ask** 1. If you currently hold Bitcoin on centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Robinhood, Kraken, Gemini etc. you should definitely consider taking self-custody. Hit us up for a free trial to the simplest Bitcoin self-custody app ever. 2. Reach out if you are curious to learn about Theya, Bitcoin and the ongoing global banking crisis, feel free to reach out.",Smeet Bhatt,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/42a4aa089e96d1507f1490f9f8430902e7d5ea68.jpg,Otherimage_28382_1.jpg;,28382

Homeflow 🏠 - Simplifying insurance for large real estate investors,"**tl;dr:** Homeflow is the first digital platform that gives large real estate investors a single place to purchase and manage insurance for their portfolio. Rather than having policies spread out between multiple agents/brokers, real estate managers can use Homeflow to view their policies, change coverages, and get quotes for upcoming acquisitions. Hi everyone, we’re Perry and Christian, co-founders of Homeflow. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/437987/6f1b3243-2701-4977-80af-bd2a8ae8254b) ### **🤔 Why are we the right ones to work on this?** [Perry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perryha95/) was the 5th business hire at Hippo Insurance and was there through the IPO, building and leading the sales operations team.  [Christian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianmgreen/) was the youngest staff engineer at Mosaic, a unicorn proptech company, where he led engineering for a new business line that grew to $10M ARR in 6 months.  ### **❌ What’s the problem?** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/437987/48a1f68f-5a21-48cc-9fb3-01549b851641) Larger real estate investors deal with inefficiencies when managing their insurance. For example, one of our partners has 200 units, and their insurance was placed with 5 different brokers across 6 insurance companies (carriers). This occurs because 1) insurance brokers are often state-specific since insurance is regulated and licensed on a state-by-state basis and 2) the insurance carriers that sell 1-4 family unit properties are frequently different from the ones that sell 5+ family unit properties.  Also, real estate investors with a traditional broker still need to call or email if they want to get an updated policy document or file a claim. As a result, the insurance experience has been highly service-dependent, only as good as the broker.  ### **👨🏼‍💻 What have we built?** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/437987/25f86ff3-7933-4817-a28d-95f00690b83e) Homeflow is the first digital platform that gives real estate investors a single place to purchase and manage insurance for their portfolio. Homeflow’s nationwide footprint and 50+ carriers provide real estate investors with a single platform for all of their insurance needs. Real estate investors can also use Homeflow’s self-service platform to view all policy documents, manage their claims, or request changes to their policy.  ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/437987/90d4c705-24af-4724-bec9-541202333dad) ### **👋 Asks:** Are you (or someone you know) a real estate investor looking to simplify and save on your insurance?

DailyBot+ AI 🧠 The assistant and toolkit for modern teams,"Hi! We are Mauricio Morales and Sergio Florez, the founders of [DailyBot](https://www.dailybot.com/product/ai?utm_source=YCLaunch). DailyBot+ AI is a toolkit for modern work: a ChatGPT Assistant and an AI Workflow automation tool that takes asynchronous work and in-chat collaboration to another level. Compatible with Slack, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, or Discord. ### **The Problem** AI is the future, yes. But many people lack the knowledge and resources to effectively incorporate AI into their daily workflow, resulting in missed opportunities for creating impactful use cases. ### **Our Solution** DailyBot provides a chat assistant and platform that simplifies the integration of AI into daily workflows. With our technology, anyone can access an AI assistant (ChatGPT) in the work chat, and can also implement use cases that leverage the power of AI. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70494&key=user_uploads/207324/1d5a25dc-bc23-4f36-8315-61af16175cf6) We provide key building blocks for you to combine and build multiple use cases on top of your chat workspace. The building blocks of DailyBot are: **Check-ins** for stand-ups or recurring surveys; **Forms** for any data collection; **Chat Commands** for in-chat customization; **Workflows** for setting up triggers/actions; and the **AI engine**. The DailyBot Workflows provide a Zapier-like interface where users can define triggers and actions (one or multiple) that should run. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70494&key=user_uploads/207324/7c533a87-fd19-4145-a9c9-4450a49a0e53) The Actions can be AI content generation, sending messages (DMs or channels), sending emails, or triggering other building blocks of DailyBot. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70494&key=user_uploads/207324/dc811400-636e-4ffb-8773-aaefa373ddc2) ### **A Few Examples** * You run a **Daily Stand-up** (built with Check-ins), then, **when a blocker is reported**, an **AI Workflow is run**. It analyzes the blocker and then suggests the employee ideas for solving the issue/bocker. * You create a **Form** that will be triggered with the in-chat command named “**product release**”, when the Form is completed an **AI Workflow is run**. It analyzes all the content of the release form **and generates a press release** that is posted into the #releases channel. * You create an **anonymous survey to monitor team morale**. The **AI analyzes all the responses** and sends a summary to the head of HR (via email or DM). We're passionate about making remote work easier and more efficient and our goal is to make DailyBot the best companion for your team’s work. **Our Ask:** We’d love to hear your ideas on what type of AI-powered daily workflows (in chat) will add value to your team, feel free to share the feedback at [support@dailybot.com](mailto:support@dailybot.com) We offer a Free Trial, [**Try DailyBot here**](https://www.dailybot.com/product/ai?utm_source=YCLaunch).",Mauricio Morales,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0c8c909c734290d1b7b36a9c93d2c2aa7f12e5c3.jpg,Otherimage_24153_1.jpg;Otherimage_24153_2.jpg;Otherimage_24153_3.jpg;,24153
Berilium - Invest in top Private Equity and Private Credit starting at $10k,"Hey everyone!  We’re Alberto, Cedric, and Dominic from [Berilium](https://berilium.com/). **TLDR:** Top Private Equity and Private Credit funds have performed better and with less risk compared to traditional stock/bond investments.  However, unless you’re writing $1-5 million+ checks, it’s difficult to access these investments.  With Berilium, you can access top private market strategies from marquee firms such as Blackstone and KKR with minimum investments as low as $10k. If you’re interested in investing, [apply to invest today](https://berilium.com/?referral=Q1HK18)!  **Why should I care?** * **Higher returns** – Private assets have historically outperformed public markets over the long term. * **Diversification** – The S&P500 is dominated by a handful of very large technology companies (4 stocks represent 20% of all the S&P500). There are 10x more private companies than public companies. * **Inflation hedging** – Ability to generate income and invest in assets that appreciate with inflation such as private credit, real estate, and infrastructure. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70479&key=user_uploads/1156184/d8e452de-d26b-4fc7-a2d5-85e7bb1006b9) **Who is Berilium for?** * Long-term investors that care about compounding their wealth and do not have $5 million+ to invest. * Those looking to augment investment options beyond public market stocks and bond portfolios from their self-directed accounts and robo-advisor services like Wealthfront. * Those who have done one-off private market deals but have no way to access private markets in a systematic way or lack access to top private funds. **Do I need to be an accredited investor to invest**? Yes, you need to be an [accredited investor](https://www.sec.gov/education/capitalraising/building-blocks/accredited-investor) per the SEC’s definition to invest. **Why invest with Berilium?** * **Access** - Invest in opportunities previously only available to institutions and ultra-high net worth individuals. * **Low minimums** – Invest starting at $10k. * **No capital calls** – Invest your full amount on day 1 into active deals. You don’t have to wait in cash until your capital is invested. * **No lengthy lock-ups** – Option to redeem your investment any calendar quarter after the first year. * **Convenient tax reporting** – Rather than painful K-1 forms, get standard 1099 tax forms, the same as you get from your regular checking and saving accounts. * **Transparent** – Fees are properly listed, no hidden expenses, straightforward performance communication. **How does it work?** * You answer a few questions, then we’ll automatically build a custom portfolio - no technical/investment knowledge required.  Just tell us your goals and we’ll build you the right solution to meet them. * The underlying investments are managed by some of the largest and most reputable private investment firms such as Blackstone and KKR. * We currently have access to over 30 different private market investment strategies that we can combine into a custom portfolio for you. **About Us:** We have done this before – we used to build and manage Private Equity/Private Credit investments for multi-billion dollar institutions such as pension plans and endowments. Now, we are accessing the same investment strategies and applying the same portfolio construction tools but for the benefit of the retail investor. **Our Ask** If you’re interested in investing, [apply to invest today](https://berilium.com/?referral=Q1HK18)!",Dominic Spinozzi,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/328241d5f8b2357a22a90616bbb9f0e5263313f3.jpg,Otherimage_27922_1.jpg;,27922
DailyPe - Repay your loans daily,"Hey! We are [Saurabh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabh-gupta2104/) and [Shashwat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashwat-shrikhande/), the founders of [DailyPe](https://dailype.in/). We met each other at IIT Kharagpur and have been friends for the past 7+ years. We’re building DailyPe — a marketplace for business loans that are paid in smaller, daily installments.\\ — ### **Problem 💸: Paying your loans in huge installments at once sucks.** Small shop owners earn daily unlike salaried people, but when it comes to loan repayment both are asked to pay monthly. For these shop owners, it is difficult to calculate how much to save each day so that they will have the required installment amount at the end of the month. Also, at the time of repayment, they end up with a big hole in their working capital. ### **Solution 💡: Reduce risk & pay small amounts daily.** **Borrower Side:** When you earn daily you pay daily and get away from the stress of huge one-time installments. Each day, a small amount of $X is deducted from your digital wallet which is on the auto-debit mandate and you don't need to worry about keeping your balance of $XXXX. You never default, and you also build your credit score.  **Lender Side:** Discover defaulters early because right from the 2nd day onward, your collection data stops you from lending in that particular demographic and geographic location. These data points wouldn't be available in the traditional way of lending till at least the 3rd month. With DailyPe, lending decisions are much more informed leading to higher collection rates and lower NPAs.   ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70455&key=user_uploads/514038/c1cbfb52-4486-4bf2-aa13-d39065cd0419) ### ### **Why us 😎** We both have seen this problem firsthand when our fathers, who ran their own businesses, would stress out days before installment day — saying that they “\\*\\*need to save and transfer money from their secondary accounts to pay for the loan.\\*\\*”  Also, while working at FinBox and ICICI bank in the past, we built products in the **lending-tech industry.** This was something we had always wanted to build. Fun fact: These loan products are called “**khandi Udhar**” which existed for a long time in the unorganized markets in India. We are making them organized 😁 ### **Ask** ❤️ **Lending Partners**: If you can connect us with banks, NBFCs, and debt institutions in India who are open to becoming finance providers for our small business owners.  **Data Points**: If you have worked on credit models, underwriting tech, risk analysis, or any sort of lending algorithm, please reach out to us at [founders@dailype.in](https://mailto:founders@dailype.in).

Narrative - Bill.com for the logistics industry,"### tl;dr: Narrative is an AI-powered invoice audit, analytics and payments tool for logistics. We automatically process contracts and compare them to invoices, create detailed dashboards and reduce payment delays. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/122596/d014dc49-4053-47cc-a54b-a83dcb3012e9) Hi everyone, we are [Suchit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dubeysuchit/) and [Akshit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/axitkhurana/) and we're on a mission to automate invoice processing and reconciliation in logistics. Suchit spent 2.5 years at Uber Freight working on tools for fortune 500 shippers for building & tracking loads, managing payments and verifying surcharges. Before that, he designed enterprise products at Palantir, Crew and Thumbtack. Akshit was on the Pytorch Mobile team at Facebook AI. Before that, he led engineering teams at [Ambient.ai](http://Ambient.ai) and shipped products at LinkedIn, NetApp, [Ginger.io](http://Ginger.io) (Headspace Health) and HouseCanary. ### **Why is this a problem?** A logistics invoice is composed of multiple variable costs like fuel prices, delays in picking up, labor costs, foreign exchange rates and shipper specific discounts. Fragmentation of the logistics industry and disconnected systems across vendors make PDFs and email the medium of exchange of information. These cause on average 20% of logistics invoices to have errors that are hard to identify manually. Suchit saw the operations team at Uber Freight spend days collecting proofs of variable costs from truck drivers, manually verifying surcharges and creating the invoices. Shippers had to verify these charges manually too. This led to errors and delays in payments. Talking to 100s of shippers and brokerages, we have seen that they audit invoices to avoid overpaying and payment delays. Current ways to combat this problem involve outsourcing the audit to a third party that removes visibility or using low accuracy software that requires a lot of time and effort ### **What is the solution?** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70452&key=user_uploads/122596/49bc4019-9603-4d99-a14d-d62a077d7f8f) Narrative is an AI-powered invoice audit, payments and analytics tool. We verify proofs submitted by drivers for brokers, invoices received by shippers highlighting the errors and missing items. * Audit invoices: Save time in managing contracts and comparing them to the invoices for all modes of logistics. * Payments: Pay invoices accurately and on time with their preferred method. * Dashboard: Track logistics spend, error rates, and carrier performance for additional savings. ### **Our asks** * If your company is a high volume shipper, we’d love to help improve your audit and spend analysis workflows.  * If you are a logistics broker or a 3PL processing invoices daily, we’d love to chat. * Schedule a demo [here](https://calendly.com/suchit-dubey/30min) or email us at [founders@trynarrative.com](mailto:founders@trynarrative.com)",Akshit Khurana,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/620a3a287009c17757f2b6b04fdd3c17444e714b.jpg,Otherimage_27814_1.jpg;Otherimage_27814_2.jpg;,27814
Warrant - Open source application authorization and access control,"![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70447&key=user_uploads/234741/7662bcdc-8497-4a8c-a0c6-428ddc3bffe0) Hey everyone! We’re Aditya and Karan! 👋 Warrant is an open source **authorization service** that **helps developers implement and enforce secure, compliant access control in their applications.** It abstracts away the complexity of building application authorization and access control so developers can instead focus on building core product features. Our cloud-first, API-first approach has enabled us to build a highly-scalable and performant service that now processes millions of customer API calls per month. Today, we’re excited to announce that Warrant is officially [open source](https://github.com/warrant-dev/warrant)! ⭐️ ### The Problem Developers, we’ve all been there. What started as a simple _isAdmin_ flag to distinguish between internal and external users — just so you could release that _one_ internal-only feature — has grown into a nightmare to maintain. It’s now a hodgepodge of booleans, database flags, and a halfway built role based access control system that not only slows down your team’s day-to-day development velocity, but also opens up your company to a slew of [costly security vulnerabilities waiting to be exploited](https://www.hackerone.com/press-release/organizations-paid-hackers-235-million-these-10-vulnerabilities-one-year-4). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70447&key=user_uploads/234741/60544231-1dac-4013-8872-c97b83878da3) What’s more? Your customers are now requesting the ability to self-manage their team’s roles and permissions, so you’ll be spending another 1-2 months building the APIs, UIs, etc. for this risky, non-differentiating feature. In short, application authorization and access control is difficult to build and even trickier to maintain as a company’s product evolves and its needs change. ### The Solution To help developers quickly build world-class access control, Warrant provides three things:\\ (1) **A centralized datastore for storing your application’s authorization policies and related data.** Warrant’s management dashboard and APIs make it dead-simple to safely modify authorization policies globally or for a single user or tenant in real-time. With Warrant, updating policies for all users as your product changes becomes a breeze. (2) **A real-time, low latency access control service for enforcing authorization policies in your application at runtime.** With official Warrant SDKs available for the most popular server-side languages and frontend frameworks, checking if a user has access becomes as easy as a call to Warrant’s _check_ method. (3) **A library of thoughtfully designed, authorization-specific UI components** that help with building self-service permission management flows, granting/denying access to privileged pages/UIs, displaying audit logs to users, and more. These components are **customizable and _permission-aware_**, so developers can drop them into any application. ### What’s Next? Join us on our journey to solve authorization and access control for all developers: * Give us a 🌟 [on GitHub](https://github.com/warrant-dev/warrant) and tell us what you’d like us to build next * Give us a follow [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/warrant_dev) to keep up with the latest Warrant features * Come discuss everything authz/access control in our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/warrantcommunity/shared_invite/zt-12g84updv-5l1pktJf2bI5WIKN4_\\~f4w) * Try out our managed cloud service, [Warrant Cloud](https://app.warrant.dev/signup)",Karan Kajla,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/bfb91f4d9bfeee0a0140bfe8b758d565bad47579.jpg,Otherimage_24507_1.jpg;Otherimage_24507_2.jpg;,24507

Cash positions and **money movements are scattered** between different platforms * **Tons of manual work** is required to aggregate this data which is prone to errors and makes it difficult to determine simple metrics such as cash flow ### 💡 **Solution** Ruby provides a better banking experience that is catered to the issues faced by e-commerce businesses. We offer: 💳 A flexible spend management system that allows you to categorize your spend as granular as you need to fit your business structure ⚡️ Instant deposits (even on the weekends!) to ensure your cash flow isn’t restricted.

It became impossible to keep track of spend and revenue without wasting hours making manual calculations from all the tools we were using. With engineering experience from top companies like Google, Capital One, and Salesforce, the team decided to come together to tackle all these issues and create a banking solution that makes tracking the financial health of your e-commerce business a breeze. ### 🙌🏼 **Asks** * If you are or know anyone who is an e-commerce business owner who wants a better banking experience and control of their finances, reach out to [founders@spendruby.com](mailto:founders@spendruby.com) or sign up for our waitlist so we can reach out to you directly! * Reach out if you are building for the e-commerce space.

Fluid Markets - Exchange to invest in company earnings,"We’re excited to share what we’re working on here at Fluid! We're launching a futures exchange to enable **direct investments in the components that influence stock prices, without taking any market risk**. For example, **invest in earnings** of a public company, **but not the equity** itself. ### **❌ Problem:** Investors model out revenue, earnings, segments and other components that determine the value of the underlying company.

Investors cannot eliminate external risk through current hedging strategies. ### **✅ Solution:** We're building an exchange to offer **futures on fundamentals of public companies.** Our futures on **revenue, earnings, and segments,** among other fundamentals, guarantee that if an investor's thesis is **correct**, they will **make money.** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70425&key=user_uploads/859404/2062d737-7782-4f76-bb75-89fdf5b581f7) ### **📚 Our Story:** Ken, Ari, and Ben are experienced entrepreneurs who have worked in derivatives and securitization investment banking at Goldman Sachs and Barclays. We encountered the problem of trying to trade fundamentals in our personal portfolios based on expectations of segment performance, and through speaking with equity investors, we've discovered it's a bigger problem than we could have imagined. ### **❓Ask:** If you are or know anyone who is a public equities investor, from hedge fund managers to asset managers, we would love to hear from you!

Fairway Health - Process prior authorization faster,"### **TL;DR** Fairway Health is an AI assistant for health insurers to quickly process patient treatment authorizations. We use LLMs to analyze long (70+ page), messy medical records and determine if a patient is eligible for a treatment. ### **What is Prior Authorization?** Prior Authorization is a process where physicians must obtain approval from a patient’s health insurance plan before a specific treatment or medication is delivered. This process can take an **average of 2-14 days, with some cases taking upwards of 15-31 days**. This prevents patients from receiving necessary treatments in a timely manner. The entire healthcare industry is also projected to **spend $36 billion each year** in administrative costs for this process.  **This process for health insurance is still manual and inefficient:** 1. Patient documents sent to health insurance are a mess and can be a **70-100+ page fax.** 2. Health insurance companies have to **allocate more headcount to try and manually check these documents** against their medical necessity criteria, costing them millions each year. ### **How it works:** We speed up the medical eligibility determination for health insurers. We ingest patient documents + criteria from health insurance plans and use LLMs to output an approval/denial decision with justification based on an evaluation of each sub-criteria. We also highlight the context within the medical document that informed the decision to allow for easy review. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70364&key=user_uploads/1096888/fceffbb3-e71a-4523-a0a9-df7c73f34c76) ### **Our ask:** Are you in health insurance or do you know anyone in health insurance?

Dittofeed - The first open-source customer engagement platform with developer tools,"**Tl;dr**: Dittofeed is a developer-focused, open-source alternative to platforms like Iterable and Customer.io. Dittofeed’s streamlined developer experience allows growth engineers to send better-performing marketing messages. Additionally, self-hosting Dittofeed delivers large cost savings to power users who are constrained by existing providers’ volume-based pricing. — Hi everyone, we’re Max and Chandler, and we're equipping the next generation of technical growth teams with the tools they need to ensure their marketing messages look great and get delivered correctly. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70363&key=user_uploads/917851/2732dae6-eed4-4b8e-99b7-88266c3aa80e) ### **The Problem**: Customer engagement platforms are expensive and error-prone. If you’ve ever received marketing emails with broken links, or opted out of a company’s texts, only to receive an “exclusive offer” text the next day, there’s a reason. And it’s not (for the most part) because growth teams are bad at their job. Current customer engagement platforms give growth teams the low-code tools they need to automate marketing messages at scale, but none of the technical tools they need to make sure they’re sending the right messages, to the right customers, at the right time. This results in reduced customer conversion and retention rates, as well as frustrated growth engineers. ### **The Solution**: An open-source customer engagement platform that empowers growth engineers. Growth teams are becoming increasingly technical, and with that, comes a huge potential for fixing buggy marketing messages. We’re building a future where growth engineers can finally version control email templates and test messaging automations in CI, and where, simultaneously, non-technical growth team members still have access to the low-code tools they’re comfortable with. Using Dittofeed, you get industry-standard features like a drag-and-drop customer journey builder, a segmentation interface, and a web-based template editor, helpful for non-technical marketers. You ALSO get technical features like: * **git-based workflows** 😎 * **a first-in-class testing SDK** 🤯 * **an OpenTelemetry integration** 🥳 * **a self-hostable platform** 🥹 Set your growth engineers up for success. Retain more customers. Save money. Everyone wins! _Jest Test Example_ ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70363&key=user_uploads/917851/36c3f478-9e0f-4494-a81c-6cf7c0ac4a60) _Journey Builder Example Workflow_ ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70363&key=user_uploads/917851/57a4c636-7de0-4849-a2cf-532f5a016bf0) Companies using Dittofeed can: 1. Save up to thousands of dollars a month by self-hosting, avoiding volume-based pricing. 2. Reliably build high conversion, high-retention marketing campaigns. 3.

They struggle with customer service due to budget constraints and often lose potential customers because of slow responses and negative experiences. Larger e-commerce sites need help managing the right team size to handle thousands of customer queries during peak times. ### **✨** The solution ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70338&key=user_uploads/517243/d93d84a5-928d-40ad-a758-3b7a22f2ac73) We developed advanced AI models to automate critical tasks in e-commerce, such as handling customer queries, processing orders, managing payments, scheduling appointments, and providing shipping updates, and integrated them into a user-friendly admin dashboard that integrates with Shopify, allowing businesses to easily manage their orders, customers, and products while monitoring the AI's performance. ### **⚙️** How it works ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70338&key=user_uploads/517243/1c825d1c-50e6-4ea2-8ccf-3ac042824dce) The AI displays products, answers questions, handles payments, and gives shipping updates via messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram DMs, Email, and soon iMessage).

🚀 ShortLoop - Automated API platform for fast-moving teams,"**TL;DR:** ShortLoop uses API traffic to automatically create a centralized API hub with up-to-date collections and dependency maps with request-response payloads. Say goodbye to juggling between Swagger, Postman, and Confluence and making manual updates. ### **🤕 The Problem:** Developers working with APIs deal with complicated JSON payloads, out-of-sync documentation, and unexpected contract changes. Existing tools rely on manual changes and do not scale when working across teams and microservices. ### **🎯 The Solution: Traffic Data 🤝 API Platform** ShortLoop intelligently samples network traffic and creates API collections and payload visibility out of the box and this stays up-to-date. Add a light-weight SDK in your backend and you get: * Up-to-date API collections * API usage and dependencies * Logs without deployment * Change Alerts ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70305&key=user_uploads/1135321/4673c7c1-dffe-490e-8956-7d37150cd3a2) ### **💪 Why we built ShortLoop!** We saw this problem firsthand in our previous companies as the product breadth and team size grew rapidly. In that fast-paced environment, we couldn’t maintain collections and documentation manually in existing tools. Teams slowed down and developer productivity suffered as people relied on meetings and slack discussions to get their work done. ### **😃 Stories from our users** > _“We try to dedicate 10% of our sprint to document APIs properly so that testing, debugging, and integrations become smooth. But there was still no single source of truth across our current tools. ShortLoop makes this very easy.”_ - Anurag Chutani (Intellect S21) _“Shortloop has quickly become a critical part of the onboarding process for new engineers on the Shyp team, saving us critical dev time.”_ - Shivam Bharuka (Shyp W23, ex-FB) ### **🙏🏻 Our Ask** * Signup [here](https://tally.so/r/w2EYW9) to try ShortLoop.  * Email [founders@shortloop.dev](mailto:founders@shortloop.dev) for any queries * Connect us to fast-growing engineering teams",Vishnu Vinjam,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/ffa5c3f2eaf1e4a6b70f3c7916c45c4d6d7f4da0.jpg,Otherimage_27892_1.jpg;,27892
🏔️ Lightski: ChatGPT for sales teams,"**tl;dr: If you want to spend more time selling and less time updating your CRM, Lightski can help! Chat with our Slackbot to quickly update fields, move opportunities through your funnel, get pre-call meeting prep, and analyze your pipeline health - no clunky UI needed.** We’re Richard and Hansen, former DoorDash and Affinity engineering managers, and we’re excited to launch Lightski! ### 🗂️ The Problem: Updating your CRM sucks Today, sales teams spend hours every week inputting data into Salesforce after calls. Each webpage takes seconds to load and requires multiple clicks to add a note or update a field. Current Slack data entry tools can’t parse natural language, also require many clicks in a Slack UI, and don’t identify the opportunity to update. Up-to-date CRM data is crucial for running a successful sales team, and managers don’t want to hound reps to input data. We want to speed up data entry so reps can get back to doing what they do best: selling. ### 💡 The Solution: Send a message to update your CRM Lightski is a faster way for sales teams to update their CRM without clicking through layers of Salesforce UIs: just tell our Slackbot what to update. We interpret your message, handle as many updates as needed, and make the corresponding changes in your CRM. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70303&key=user_uploads/68558/c3e0ca90-cb01-4ee4-a0e7-cddaf374bef1) Teams can also set triggers to receive pre-call meeting prep in Slack, quickly analyze their funnel, and build custom integrations. Over time, we’ll build smart alerts when data is stale, answer analytics questions such as quota attainment, directly suggest updates from a call, and use GPT-4 to help reps build sales decks (and other tedious work). ### ▶️ Interested?

Parsagon: Universal API for product data,"### **✨ TL;DR** Hi YC! We’re excited to announce that [Parsagon](https://parsagon.io/) is offering an API with which you can **collect product data from any e-commerce site with 1 API call**. ### **🤯 The Problem** If you’re trying to get data on products from e-commerce sites like Amazon, Etsy, etc., you essentially have 2 options: 1. 1\\. Develop or purchase web scrapers for every site, which are time-consuming and expensive to build and maintain. 2. 2\\. Use a product data API, where you provide a URL to a product page, and the API tries to extract product data from the page via ML models. This is cheaper, but these APIs often return inaccurate data for 20+% of product pages. We’ve seen these APIs say the price of a $350 TV was $16 because the warranty was $16, we’ve seen them say a price was $3400 when it was really $34.00, we’ve seen them say products were in stock when they were out of stock—the list goes on and on. As developers, we at Parsagon have spent countless hours building and maintaining such web scrapers and wishing that we could use a product data API without sacrificing the accuracy and reliability of custom scrapers. ### **💡 The Solution** **Parsagon provides a product data API with near 100% reliability.** We avoid the inaccuracies of previous product data APIs by using a novel AI to generate custom scrapers for every e-commerce website, ensuring that we consistently return accurate data for each site. Just give our API a URL for a product or list of products, and Parsagon will build a scraper for the site (if it hasn’t already) and return data for your product(s) with a standardized format. For example, giving the API the URL for this page ![uploaded image](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=70282&key=user_uploads/145104/ac033de5-2e1e-4e30-b6bf-0b8dbb1faf28) yields: ``` { ``` ``` \""name\"": \""Amazon eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi system | Supports speeds up to 500 mbps | Connect to Alexa | Coverage up to 4,500 sq. ft. | 3-pack, one router + two extenders, 2020 release\"", \""price\"": 179.99, \""regular_price\"": 199.99, \""currency\"": \""$\"", \""sku\"": \""B085WSCTS4\"", \""out_of_stock\"": false, . . . ``` ``` } ``` And giving the API the URL for this page ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70282&key=user_uploads/145104/061755a7-0e01-4b75-8fa1-080259038282) yields > ``` > [ > > ``` > > ``` > { > \""name\"": \""WICKER KURA BED- Pretty Stickers- Peel and Stick- Gifts- Adhesive Kura Bed Designs- Room Decor- Wicker Designs- Customizable Kura Beds\"", > \""link\"": \""https://www.etsy.com/listing/1141689620/wicker-kura-bed-pretty-stickers-peel-and?click_key=aa9bb9d8d3aaf77acefa1143c7d023c6631c1c59%3A1141689620&click_sum=5ea4b26e&ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=beds&ref=search_grid-367299-1-1&pro=1&frs=1\"", > \""price\"": 58.99, > \""regular_price\"": 78.66, > \""currency\"": \""$\"", > \""sku\"": \""1141689620\"", > \""out_of_stock\"": false, > . . . > }, > { > \""name\"": \""Upholstered SOFT WALL PANELS for King or Queen size beds.\"", > . . . > }, > . . . > ] > > ``` ### **❓ Our Asks** If you want an easier way to collect product data, email us at [founders@parsagon.io](mailto:founders@parsagon.io)",Sandy Suh,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/8afad87b2d165c28bfca4bb284282600e06150f2.jpg,Otherimage_22832_1.jpg;Otherimage_22832_2.jpg;,22832
Shyp: Marketplace for freight movement in India 🚚 🚚,"Hello! We’re Shivam and Sanchit, and we’re building Shyp. Shyp is an online marketplace that helps businesses move freight in India. 😰 **Problem** Even though India is at the cusp of a digital transformation with half a billion internet users, the country’s $150 billion road freight industry is still plagued with several inefficiencies such as infrastructure constraints, slow-moving processes, and lack of ​​technology adoption. Can you believe that over 90% of India’s road freight operations still rely on phone calls and physical documents for load matching and booking? This leads to higher costs, longer turnaround times, and lower efficiency. We’re building Shyp to address these challenges and rebuild the backbone of India’s expanding economy. 🚀 **Solution** Shyp connects shippers and carriers in real-time, which ensures that freight is moved efficiently and quickly. Our platform provides shippers access to a wide range of carriers, resulting in cost savings and increased visibility. At the same time, carriers can find the best freight to transport, which ensures that their trucks are always full, maximizing their efficiency and reducing empty miles. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70280&key=user_uploads/312220/9fc51d34-df16-48c4-9b1f-63f7fd33b271) Our platform is built on cutting-edge technology, which makes it easy for shippers and carriers to manage their freight. We offer real-time tracking, which enables shippers to track their freight at every stage of transit. Additionally, our document management system makes it easy to manage and share important documents, eliminating the need for physical paperwork. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70280&key=user_uploads/312220/2ee73585-d8ff-4ec8-9ec3-fd1ebf5c7fe5) Shyp is designed to be scalable, which means that we can add new features and services as needed. This enables us to stay ahead of the curve and meet the evolving needs of the logistics industry in India. By making logistics more efficient, cost-effective, and hassle-free, we are enabling businesses across the country to grow and prosper. We are excited about the potential of our platform and are committed to driving growth in the Indian logistics industry. 🎯 **Why us?** Sanchit has over five years of experience in the supply chain and logistics space. He was a lead software engineer at Uber Freight from its early days and played a vital role in representing the team in numerous strategic partnerships and integrations. Prior to that, Sanchit worked in Walmart's supply chain division, where he led several products for their warehousing and fleet-related operations. Meanwhile, Shivam knows shipping well - his family owns a manufacturing company in India that does $100M in revenue, spending over $10M a year on shipping and logistics. Additionally, his role as a staff software engineer in the AI Infra team at Meta gives him a valuable skill set to leverage in the development of our platform. 🙏🏻 **Ask** Introduce us to people who have built similar B2B marketplaces.

For example, hiring someone might mean pulling down compensation data from Pave, populating an offer letter in Greenhouse, then setting them up in Rippling when the candidate accepts. Even the most simple daily workflows can involve passing information between 3 and 5 different services. Layup turns this into a one-shot prompt. We're on a mission to help individuals and organizations streamline their daily tasks with simple prompts so that they can focus on what matters most.

Vaero - Fivetran for log data,"**Tl;dr: Vaero helps security teams collect, filter and transform, and write all their logs to any destination. This enables security teams to collect and store all the logs they need, while archiving logs that they don’t need right now.** **☄️ The Problem:** The #1 complaint of every Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at a mid-market or enterprise company is the millions of dollars that they have to spend to store logs from all of their systems. Overall storage costs are getting worse because data volumes in companies are growing 25% year over year. Companies log every access and event on thousands of systems, from servers, firewalls, and cloud infrastructure to SaaS and cybersecurity software. Most of the time the logs are unnecessary, but companies need to keep the logs around in case there is a security incident they need to investigate, or for compliance. As a result, security teams need to collect all their logs and route them to different types of storage based on the type of analysis or retention required. Legacy tools like Fluentd and Logstash are slow and rely on long, clunky YAML files. Many modern security teams have tried to build a homegrown solution with scripts, but this problem is too complex for most in-house teams to solve. **💡 The Solution:** We provide modern data pipelines for logs for security teams to collect logs from any source, filter and transform them, and write the logs to any destination. * Vaero is the most _developer-friendly_ solution by allowing writing log pipelines with Python code, rather than forcing users to learn a new YAML config format or domain specific language * Intuitive dashboard for users who don’t code * Native integrations to more log sources, so users can get all their logs without coding their own integrations * Ultrafast performance and throughput with 100% Go implementation **⭐️ Why us?** We are [Bryant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryant-lee/) and [Earl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/earlhathaway/), 2nd time founders whose prior startups have collectively raised $80M+. * Bryant previously co-founded Cognition IP, which achieved 7 figures of annual revenue and was backed by Khosla Ventures, Mayfield Fund, and Y Combinator.

Fastgen - Low-Code API and workflow builder,"### **☕️TL;DR** **Fastgen is a low-code API and workflow builder with an integrated Postgres DB.** **Our current customers use Fastgen to build backends for MVPs or internal tools and automate repetitive workflows for GTM, operations, or marketing teams.** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70265&key=user_uploads/334116/9b34df33-c911-4794-a329-8a7569e52502) ### **Origin Story** This is our second YC company. With Blair (YC S19), we raised more than $100M to help students get access to education in the US. One of our constant questions was how we could move even faster. We are building Fastgen to answer that question and are building a tool we wish we had during our time at Blair. ## **What is Fastgen** ### **REST APIs** Fastgen's API Builder enables you to quickly create any REST API by using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Our platform also includes pre-built integrations to popular tools such as Sendgrid, Slack, and Twilio and the ability to connect to any external API you need for data exchange. We launch new integrations every week to make our users’ lives even easier. Instead of spending hours integrating third-party APIs and dealing with hosting, you can drag and drop the action into an API flow and deploy it with the click of a button.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70265&key=user_uploads/334116/9975f322-3ebe-4ca1-806f-520196fcc9af) ### **Workflows** With Fastgen, you can create time-based workflows that trigger at regular intervals and event-based workflows through the same user interface as the API builder. One of the standout features of Fastgen is the flexibility to define any action in a workflow or API as a custom event, which can then be utilized as a trigger for a separate workflow.  ### **Database** Fastgen's integrated Postgres DB simplifies creating, reading, updating, and deleting data within your applications. You can easily build and manage your database alongside your APIs and workflows, all within one platform. If you have your own Postgres DB and don't want to use our hosted solution, Fastgen seamlessly connects to your database so you can take advantage of our platform's other features without changing your database setup. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70265&key=user_uploads/334116/f889316f-2fbe-485f-b7f5-b88e7fcec9d2) **Our ask:** * If you want to be part of our private beta, sign up on [fastgen.com](http://fastgen.com) * Mention that you saw us on Launch YC for prioritized onboarding",Mike Mahlkow,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/f80a1d8a7cdc4a21cffeed07265e056cf6821f0b.jpg,Otherimage_27974_1.jpg;Otherimage_27974_2.jpg;Otherimage_27974_3.jpg;,27974

🅿️PoloPay - Dynamic menus for LatAm restaurants and coffee shops,"### ☕️**TL;DR:** PoloPay is a dynamic menu that allows guests to order food and drinks, split, tip, and pay the bill in seconds helping LatAm restaurants and coffee shops automate manual tasks and increase sales. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70252&key=user_uploads/961294/ea4d9bbb-cb80-4b59-92d7-cf405e76fe79) ### 🌯**Founding Team** We are Aldo, Andres, and Juan, the team behind PoloPay! [Andres Richardson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andres-richardson-41411a167/) **(CEO)** is from Mexico, a Summa Cum Laude Industrial Engineer from the University of Michigan, and an ex-business consultant whose work ranges from industrial production & logistics optimization to organizational restructuring in various industries. [Juan Chomali](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jchomali/) **(CTO)** is from Chile, creator of Boreal, the most downloaded and used Hacker News client for iPhone in 2016 until Apple took it down, a Mechanical Engineer and Economist from the University of Michigan, PNAS Co-Author, an ex-Goldman Sachs STRATS, and started coding at the age of 12.  [Aldo Piaggio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aldo-piaggio-59227418b/) **(CDO)** is from Honduras, an Industrial Engineer from the University of Michigan with a minor in Economics, passed the CFA Level 1, an ex-Goldman Sachs IBD analyst, designs since the age of 14, and is the third-generation of a family involved in the food & beverage industry since 1972. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70252&key=user_uploads/961294/ac91ccc3-b653-4211-8be3-a5f9f80943d9) ### 👨🏼‍🍳**The “Why?”** **The dining experience** has been the same for decades. You sit down, stare at a menu, look around wondering what others at the venue like, and a few “Uhmmm”s later, staff comes around to take an order you are still not even sure about. Splitting and paying the bill is a tedious waiting game, and tipping staff is close enough to a math exam. **What could be done in a few seconds, takes several minutes.** **A coffee shop is no different**. Join the line and wait a few minutes until it's your turn to go “Uhmmm”, just like everyone before you. Finally you get to sit down, and start sipping. Did you just run out of that delicious matcha latte? Stand up, and wait on line again! **What’s frustrating for guests is wasteful for venues.** Restaurants, coffee shops, and hospitality venues alike have seen their margins shrink well before covid, especially small and medium venues. They operate in an industry where costs are highly volatile, staff turnover rate is a staggering 75% (higher than any other industry), and guest preferences are quickly changing.  Resources are limited, especially for these venues. **So how does PoloPay help?** ### 🫗**Our approach** We built an easy-to-use tool that **restaurants love**. PoloPay improves how teams and staff manage their menus, fulfill orders, and collect payments.  **To help venues sell more,** our QR codes expose guests to beautiful pictures of dishes and the perfect drink pairing. PoloPay makes it as easy as possible to order that next dirty martini while giving staff a breather during peak hours; eliminating unattended parties and decreasing checkout times to seconds. **We seek to perfectly complement the warmth of hospitality.** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70252&key=user_uploads/961294/f79e41b8-9451-48d3-90f1-863eadda2878) **Are costs increasing?** Venues can adjust menu prices or food offerings, instantly charge for them, and forget the need to spend on reprints or waiting for new menus to arrive. **PoloPay also leverages data** to help capture guests' preferences, identify new areas of opportunity, and surprise guests on their next visit. Automatic language translations, powerful availability and pricing scheduling, 86-ing, and in-menu promos are a few other reasons why chefs, staff, and owners love us. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70252&key=user_uploads/961294/4d22eff1-056e-4079-a89d-0f201144c2a4) Beautiful experiences are at the core of what we build. We aim to grant guests a seamless experience and give much-needed control back to restaurant teams. We are not “X for LatAm”, **we are PoloPay**. ### 🍽️**Our ask** If you, or someone you might know, manages a restaurant or coffee shop, [reach out!](https://polopay.co/demo) **We would love to start working with your venue and would appreciate any warm intros too.** [Sign up](https://polopay.co/demo) before April 1st and enjoy a 50% discount during your first two months!",Aldo Piaggio,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/8820a2841b75bf6466eb2b9090656bdfcbb6fea7.jpg,Otherimage_27846_1.jpg;Otherimage_27846_2.jpg;Otherimage_27846_3.jpg;Otherimage_27846_4.jpg;,27846
⌨️ Teclada: The modern terminal for modern developers,"### **✨ TL;DR** [Teclada](https://www.teclada.com/?utm_source=launchyc&utm_medium=social) replaces SSH and your local Terminal app, giving you a powerful, efficient terminal experience from any browser. Out of the box, Teclada provides what terminals should have always had: from persistent connections and panes, to autocomplete that pops up like an IDE. We’ve added AI command writing as well, to make it easy to pipe together advanced terminal commands from plain English. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70245&key=user_uploads/1146313/5b349276-0e9d-489f-9bdd-f43c7293c514) ### **🙌 Who is Teclada for?** Developers, admins, or anyone that spends time in the terminal. Teclada is useful if you spend 8 hours a day in the terminal due to its powerful features, and it’s also useful if you only spend 5 minutes a quarter. It’s simple to get in, run commands, and get out. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70245&key=user_uploads/1146313/8793fb3c-b42a-45c8-bfd8-44d905d8425f) ### **🤯 The Problem** The terminal can be frustrating and unintuitive. Over the last three decades, it hasn’t kept up with the features developers generally expect. For example: * There’s no built-in session persistence, meaning your commands die if your connection dies. * There’s no way to collaborate. (eg, debugging with others is reduced to copy-paste.) * There’s no automatic panels or tiling, leaving you to deal with tens of tabs or windows. * A lack of convenience features like an autocomplete that gives you visual feedback or AI assistance. * Although workarounds exist for some of these difficulties, the workarounds are cumbersome and require deep technical knowledge to pull off. The terminal isn’t the only pain — **SSH** hasn’t aged well either: Disconnected connections, ssh key management, IP addresses, firewalls, and account sharing are painful. Lost command history and bashrc files that don’t carry over just make it all the worse. # **💡 Solution** Teclada allows you to see your computers and share access to them entirely from a browser. You open individual terminal sessions from our website, then run commands just like you normally would. You can even use it as a local terminal. Once you start typing, useful hints pop up to help. By writing `ai:` followed by an English request, Teclada will generate a command that does what you asked for. If you need to step away, you can later pick up your terminal session exactly as you left off. Your commands keep running in the background. Finally, you can share your live terminal with other users in real-time, just like sharing and typing in a Google Doc. # **Efficiency Features** ✔️ **Persistent, panel-based sessions**: Your commands keep running, even when you disconnect. Terminal sessions stay organized in groups. ✔️ **AI assistance**: Write what you want in plain English, and get it converted to useful shell commands, no matter how gnarly your request is. ✔️ **Real-time collaboration & Simple ACLs**: Share your terminal sessions just like a Google Doc across multiple tabs or computers. Share live terminals and computer access via email addresses— and give others view-only or execute access on your computers. ✔️ **Any computer, anywhere**: All you need is a browser and a login to connect to your computers. No IP addresses, firewalls, or ssh keys to get in the way. ### **👓 The co-founders** We’re David and Ian 👋 We’re both engineers in security, and have been building security products for the last 7 years at Google.

Rosettic — Break down cloud costs by product and customer,"[Rosettic](http://rosettic.com) attributes AWS, GCP and Azure costs to features, products, teams and customers. These data help companies understand how their profitability breaks down by product and customer, allowing them to make optimal strategic decisions about pricing, resource allocation and cloud architecture. ### Problem Most tech companies **don’t know how much it costs to serve each of their customers with each of their products**. Cloud costs are typically a tech company’s second-largest cost (after personnel), and they can vary significantly even on a per-unit basis, i.e. irrespective of volume. Without per-customer and per-product cost information, companies can’t reliably know: 1. What’s our margin on Customer A? 2. What’s our margin on Product B? 3. Which usage events drove Customer C’s costs last month? 4. What are our costs likely to be on new Customer D? Normally, if a finance, sales or pricing team wants to know the answer to one of these questions, they have to either 1) **make an estimate that could be wildly inaccurate** based on average total costs or 2) “**track down an engineer** to run experiments in AWS.” (That was a direct quote from a Series A CFO.) ### Solution ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1165030/95319632-5968-4935-b992-e71380c6a42a) **Rosettic answers these questions** by monitoring backend services (servers, databases, etc.) with lightweight agents. These agents **attribute the activity on each cloud service to specific features and customers** using distributed tracing and continuous profiling. Then, the usage data are **mapped to cost** data via AWS/GCP/Azure billing APIs. The result is a complete picture of who and what are driving cloud costs over time. Granular cloud cost data allow companies to: 1. Know if they’re pricing an existing customer too low—or below cost. 2. Hone in on individual lines of code and architectural decisions that incur disproportionate costs. (Other tools can only give generic cost-cutting recommendations based on total costs, e.g. “consider reserving storage in advance for a discount,” since they just repackage existing AWS billing data.) 3. Give customers who complain about high bills or opaque pricing an adequate explanation (and perhaps even suggested usage patterns to reduce future bills). 4. Better forecast the cost of serving a new customer based on expected usage. This helps teams price contracts optimally to hit margin goals consistently. ### Setup Installation only involves deploying Rosettic agents to each service of interest. This takes five minutes and requires **zero code changes**. Although our backend is cloud-based by default, **Rosettic can be self-hosted** for companies that need to keep all data within their ecosystem. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1165030/943447c4-84fd-4a29-a67c-46f3ae266fcc) _This is the entire setup for AWS Lambda, a popular cloud service._ ### Why Now Supply and demand factors make now the perfect time to launch this product: * **Supply**: Monitoring technologies eBPF and OpenTelemetry have come a long way in the past few years. Both technologies allow seamless monitoring of different technology stacks, removing friction where engineering teams would have otherwise needed to make significant investments in setup and maintenance. Application performance monitoring companies like Datadog have proven that monitoring dozens of services is technically feasible and can be profitable even at scale. * **Demand**: As the cost of capital has increased and fundraising has become less certain, profitability is the only way to guarantee business survival. Business and engineering leaders are placing newfound importance on margin health. Given these factors, this opportunity emerged in the last twelve months. ### Get in Touch Inquiries can be sent to [team@rosettic.com](mailto:team@rosettic.com). ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1165030/e5803ab1-04cb-4a16-b4f5-f87c2ec6bb68) Rosettic’s founders met in college at Stanford University.

SuperAPI - Make all your fetch APIs cacheable,"### **✨ TL;DR** SuperAPI is a programmable API gateway that makes all your fetch APIs cacheable, and makes sure your cached API responses never goes stale. Hey everyone - it’s Aditya and Adithya here introducing **SuperAPI**.\\ \\ — ### **🤯 Problem** A lot of application APIs are considered non-cacheable either because: 1. the underlying data changes frequently 2. they use GraphQL making it difficult to cache 3. they’re REST APIs that fetch using POST because they have their search parameters within the body Most applications in this situation do not cache their API responses, and end up serving APIs with a high latency, or setup multiple clusters close to their users to give them low latencies. # **💡 Solution** SuperAPI makes such APIs cacheable by monitoring your incoming **POST / PUT / PATCH** API calls, and your database updates to invalidate stale data and keep your API cache fresh. Because we listen to your database changes, SuperAPI can also update your cache in-place. This means, any updates in your database will only modify the relevant portions of your cached API responses. This reduces the amount of computations on your database & compute instances, helping reduce your cloud spend. # **🚀 How does SuperAPI work?** SuperAPI can either be deployed as a separate API gateway, or can run on top of other caching providers like **Cloudflare & Cloudfront.** This API gateway listens to all incoming update API calls (POST / PUT / PATCH), and invalidates any API cache that could go stale as a result of this incoming update API call. We also have a tiny docker container running within your network that listens to your database updates (using the replication stream or database triggers), which helps us catch any invalidations coming from internal cron jobs & batch processes. Read more about how SuperAPI works [here](https://trysuperapi.com/blog/how-does-superapi-work-clet0rvf1446071ko73x4q6qtr). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70198&key=user_uploads/11606/c7fdb60e-043e-49d6-b23b-e6123de076e6) # **📜 How did we get here?** Both of us founders worked together at a Tiger Global backed Indian tech company before starting on SuperAPI. I was the first engineer there, and built out majority of the product & platform for the first couple of years. For the next 2 years, I was heading the engineering team, growing the team from 6 engineers to \\~55 engineers, designers & PMs. Aditya was heading the platform engineering team, where he built a majority of the infrastructure to scale the platform and bring down the API latencies to less than 50ms. We’ve been obsessed with API latencies since our time working together, and are using a lot of learnings from back then to build out SuperAPI. # ❓ **Asks** If you are looking to **reduce your API latencies**, let’s talk.

inBuild - Financial automation for home builders,"Hi there! [Ty](https://twitter.com/tysharp_ib) and [Ian Sharp](https://twitter.com/iansharp_iB) here from [inBuild](https://www.inbuild.ai/). Our team is building a platform that automates the workflow of financial documents by plugging into email accounts, extracting incoming documents, and processing them all the way into existing accounting systems. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70189&key=user_uploads/1115776/47d121da-2a70-4dfb-b36e-9af7ab09ab36) Over the last 12 months, inBuild has processed over $450M of invoice volume with over $8M flowing through the platform daily. Customers rave about inBuild saying: “You often hear 'under promise and over deliver'. I don't believe that is the business model of inBuild, but they continually over-deliver.“ - Joey Zikor, CFO at [Finbro Construction](https://www.finbroconstruction.com/) ### Problem Financial management should be seamless, but construction companies are faced with… * high document volumes. * no industry standardizations. * complicated approval workflows. * outdated legacy software (yuck 🤮) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70189&key=user_uploads/1115776/b71952c8-eb4d-4d6c-bc97-8c2b92c153df) ### Solution A simple interface that works for you not against you, by… * ingesting incoming emails. * customizing account details. * learning from interaction. * automating document lifecycles. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70189&key=user_uploads/1115776/c39a25f3-9256-4a43-8e2d-ce0546f5c823) ### Team Ty was the CFO of a large luxury home builder and was working with real estate developers that collectively process over $250M in construction volume each year. His brother Ian was the Director of Growth at Gainfully, a Series A startup based in the Bay Area, and assisted in the company's successful acquisition. The brothers teamed up to tackle this challenge after cold-calling over 2,000 home builders. What they learned was that a custom home takes 18-24 months to build and during that time the contractor will receive more than 18,000 invoices from vendors and subs, each with as many as 100 line items that all need to be verified and cross-checked to budgets and contracts. The process desperately needs to be automated and we have the backgrounds to make that happen. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70189&key=user_uploads/1115776/441f1209-cad6-4c31-a995-f7b161c267c0) ### Asks Please reach out if you know any… * [referrals to home builders](mailto:sales@inbuild.ai). * [talented individuals looking for work](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/inbuild/jobs). * [connections to investors](mailto:founders@inbuild.ai).",Ty Sharp,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0785b1afc15abda180559ab1e04b44c3910316f9.jpg,Otherimage_28019_1.jpg;Otherimage_28019_2.jpg;Otherimage_28019_3.jpg;Otherimage_28019_4.jpg;,28019

"Portalform: The API data you need, straight from your database","_TLDR: Portalform syncs customers’ data from popular APIs straight into your database to power your SaaS integrations. We help your team skip months of development (and years of maintenance), and focus on what really matters: your core product and features._ Hey, [Felipe here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipearp/). I’m a software engineer who spent the last 3+ years building apps and plugins for e-commerce companies. Project after project, I was shocked at the amount of boilerplate required just to reliably sync from 3rd-party APIs. I decided to start Portalform to solve this problem and help SaaS companies ship faster. Let me explain: 👇 ## **The Problem** If you’re building a SaaS tool, you’re probably hoping to ship some integrations next quarter. To do so, your team will have to write a ton of code to authenticate, paginate, backfill, and listen for changes on each API you’re reading from. Once all this work is done, you will need to worry about hosting, maintaining and scaling this integration pipeline… _forever_. 😱 If your API vendor is in a fragmented vertical such as finance or HRIS, you are probably better off using a unified API to skip most of this integration trouble. Otherwise, if you need deep integrations with unique tools, you’re out of luck. You had to do all this work from scratch. **_But now…_** you can use Portalform! 🌀 ## **The Solution** Portalform is an ETL service that is laser-focused on the needs of _developers_ (no offense to data people). We help you skip the work of pulling users’ data from 3rd-party APIs (eg. their Quickbooks reports, Salesforce accounts, Github issues etc), and just consume it straight from your main database: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70073&key=user_uploads/203888/dfc9f660-4146-4ece-9146-b1b83d0a928f) _(Yes, we have a great dashboard too, but you don’t even need to use it!)_ Here are all the required steps: 1. Register your database with us. (We will walk you through creating a database user that can’t access any of your existing, sensitive information.) 2. Choose which third-party API to pull data from, and which of their resources you need. 3. Hit the Portalform API whenever a client connects your SaaS to this third-party tool. That’s it. You can now focus on your core products, knowing the user data you need will be kept up-to-date inside your database. 🤘 ## **The Ask** Are you or someone you know building a SaaS? Let’s chat! You can [pick a time here](https://calendly.com/portalform/25min) or email me directly at [felipe@portalform.com](mailto:felipe@portalform.com).",Felipe Aragão,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/2f2fa3fb5587118a18c645ca60719a121f009d8f.jpg,Otherimage_27928_1.jpg;,27928
1stCollab — Run an influencer marketing campaign in less than 30 minutes 🎉,"### **TL;DR** Influencer marketing is one of the most efficient ways to reach and acquire new customers, but it’s tedious to run campaigns. By leveraging machine learning and our prior campaign data, 1stCollab lets you run a campaign in under 30 minutes. Visit [1stcollab.com](http://1stcollab.com) to get started with your next influencer marketing campaign! ### **Why is influencer marketing hard?** From our time working at large social media platforms, we know that influencer marketing consistently outperforms organic ads. Unfortunately, launching an influencer campaign is a manual and lengthy process. _Launching an influencer campaign takes weeks_, while launching Google ads takes just minutes.  The first step of every influencer campaign is to find the right creators to work with—which often takes over 50 hours per campaign. Existing solutions cost tens of thousands of dollars and operate off inaccurate data. As a result, the majority of influencer marketers spend hours manually searching on YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram. From there, they have to manually calculate stats, vet a creator’s audience, evaluate past partnerships, and negotiate rates and contract terms, review creatives, report out campaign metrics, and finally submit payments. This whole process often takes 2+ weeks for a single campaign. ### **How does it work?** 1stCollab lets you launch an influencer marketing campaign in minutes—not weeks. All you have to do is find a single influencer who's relevant to your brand and target customers. Then: 1. Use our [influencer look-alike discovery tool](https://www.1stcollab.com/) to identify, vet, and save additional influencers you'd like to work with. We do what the best influencer marketers do: identify a single relevant creator, dig through that creator’s community, identify additional relevant creators, and repeat the process—but automatically. 2. Send us your list of saved influencers and tell us about your campaign goals and budget. 3. We'll take care of everything from there. All you have to do is approve the content that the influencers will post. We support campaigns on all platforms. Our self-serve discovery tool currently supports YouTube, and we’re launching for Instagram and TikTok soon. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70145&key=user_uploads/1168808/a5397e58-9fda-4820-8ec8-945d2930f80d) ### **Our Team** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70145&key=user_uploads/1168808/214846e7-6c27-47c6-9213-4ecac24313be) Our team has built some of the largest and most-used discovery and ML systems in the world, and has led industry-leading influencer marketing programs. * [Leon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonqlin/) spent nine years at Pinterest, where he was most recently Head of Discovery Product.  * [Varun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bansalvarunb/) was at Pinterest for five years, where he led product for both the Creator Engagement and Recommendations teams.  * [Carina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carina-cater/) led influencer marketing at Whatnot, Robinhood, and Curology. * [Andrew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeyu-liu/) was the tech lead for the Recommendations and Search team at Coupang and the Recommendations team at Pinterest. * [Kevin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinlau93/) was a Founding Engineer and tech lead for the Machine Learning team at Abnormal Security and earlier, an engineer on the Recommendations team at Pinterest. ### **Our Ask** * **Want to give influencer marketing a try?** We'd love to help!

Muffin Data — Simple analytics for food and beverage brands,"**TL;DR: **[**Muffin Data**](https://muffindata.com)** is an analytics platform built specifically for your favorite food and beverage brands sold in retail stores.** ### **😔 The problem** If you’re selling products in retail (imagine any packaged product the next time you’re walking down the aisle at Whole Foods), there are huge barriers for you to take action on your data. These barriers are incredibly painful, costing **time, money, and manual effort**: * **Disparate data:** all your data lives in separate portals and is hard to combine in a meaningful way * **No automation:** almost **no data** in our space is exposed via programmatic API * **No standardization:** because everyone is pulling manually, everyone problem-solves in their own bespoke way ### 📊 **The solution** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70143&key=user_uploads/1165044/91bbd312-7cac-4a53-816f-265620c70d99) To solve this, we connect to your brand’s major data sources — **retailer portals** (daily sales for each store and product a brand sells) and **distribution portals** (shipments to stores and inventory) — to extract, normalize, and enrich the data for common analytics use cases. Our first product gives the end-user an easy plug-and-play dashboard to understand **velocity and distribution** at at the **retailer, store, and product** level. Under the hood, it’s the first unified data warehouse built specifically for food and beverage. ### **🌱 Our backstory** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70143&key=user_uploads/1165044/4906d8a4-7c0a-4f1e-b002-a22ceb6ab3c2) We ([Andrés Recalde](https://linkedin.com/in/andres-s-recalde) and [Sal Calvo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salcalvo)) met building data warehouses at a startup called RJMetrics. Andrés went on to build data teams in the CPG industry at fast-growing brands like La Colombe, Gopuff, and Banza — and realized along the way how limited the existing data tooling for the industry really is.

Cakework - Custom user code in any developer product,"**tldr** _We make it easy to run custom user code using APIs instead of infrastructure. Build extensibility directly into your developer product, or launch your own serverless cloud solution._ Hi friends, we're Jessie and Eric from [Cakework](https://www.cakework.com). We're ex-AWS engineers that got tired of managing infra and wanted our tools to do it for us. We started Cakework to bake serverless into every developer product and never have to host our own code again. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70142&key=user_uploads/461027/608b19e2-7cf0-4402-8173-aa280ba89b58) [Jessie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyoung73/) - Senior Engineer that led development of AWS call center AI analytics and NLP services. [Eric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericchen90/) - Engineering Manager that led a team of engineers, scientists, and clinicians in building AWS services for healthcare. **Problem** Modern developer experiences let users run custom code natively, so users can build extensions and applications without any devops. This can be anything from in-browser scripting to webhook handlers or web services that deploy from Github. Building a platform to do this is hard because cloud services like AWS are designed by default to run your code, not your users'. You need to package your users code, handling dependencies and multiple languages. You need to provide logging, metrics, and metering. Serverless options like Lambda help with security and cost, but have restrictions on timeout and prevent you from using protocols like gRPC. You’re basically building your own Heroku. One of our early customers had given up on building their own serverless cloud solution. With us, they were able to launch in a week. **How did we do it?** Cakework is a set of simple APIs for building serverless directly into your developer product. You describe how you want to package and run your users' code, and use Cakework to build images from Github, CLI, or even a browser. You use our APIs to run that code securely, and show logs and metrics back to your users. Here's a gif of Cakework in action with a developer SaaS tool that wanted their users to be able to run custom code on webhooks in their system. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70142&key=user_uploads/461027/72dd917a-6381-4859-8341-6d278385f1d0) You can build your own in-browser scripting with multiple languages! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70142&key=user_uploads/461027/7a15ec40-7de5-4641-8a73-87b612c1ba7c) **Asks** We're onboarding customers in early access now.

Mogara - Automatic software R&D capitalization 💰,"**TL;DR** Mogara automates capitalizing software R&D expenses (now required for all software companies filing taxes in the US).  Let’s talk if you do accounting at a software company with 30+ engineers and are responsible for R&D capitalization. ### **Problem** The IRS made a change that impacts all software companies filing taxes in the US for the 2022 tax year and beyond: everyone needs to capitalize their software development costs. For most accounting and engineering leaders, this is painful news: they’ll review projects over a quarter, determine what’s capitalizable based on the Internal Revenue Code, and send time tracking surveys for engineers to fill out on a quarterly basis. The time tracking surveys will need to be completed in order for accounting to close the books.  Relying solely on issue trackers like Jira is not much better. Controllers say the fields they need aren’t reliably filled in, so they end up in a painful spiral of reminders - or falling back on time tracking surveys. ### **Solution** Mogara automates software R&D capitalization. Every software company filing taxes in the US now needs to capitalize software R&D, representing a $13B opportunity for a process that’s currently manual reporting. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70141&key=user_uploads/881211/c0f0c07e-517d-4a9f-a100-afe1683c747a) 💻 Integrate with your software team’s IDE(s) & code repository for data collection ⚙️ Connect with issue tracking tools like Jira for easy categorization 💸 Tie in payroll data from your HRIS system to determine capitalizable costs for software development 🔢 Set up and track capitalizable projects with a simple wizard interface ### **How’d we get here?** We’ve built simple user experiences for complex financial systems. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70141&key=user_uploads/881211/468ad4e6-2f34-4ec4-862d-f5f0ad664c5c) Neha worked as a product manager at Affirm building traceability and reporting for the company’s multi-million dollar daily money movements. She saw how tough it could be for the accounting team to get the data they needed from software teams.

"BuildFlow - Open source framework for easy, fast, and reliable data pipelines","Hey YC! We’re Caleb and Josh from LaunchFlow, a platform for building streaming data pipelines quickly using python. We’re excited to announce our open-source framework [BuildFlow](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow). BuildFlow lets you build a data pipeline by simply attaching a decorator to a python function. All you need to do is describe where your input is coming from (e.g. Google PubSub) and where your output should be written to (e.g. BigQuery) and BuildFlow handles the rest. No configuration outside of the code is required. Example Usage: > ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70138&key=user_uploads/1215135/145bb5e6-b1e1-4f6f-95e6-b24c93f97a63) BuildFlow was inspired by our time at Verily (Google Life Sciences) where we designed an internal platform to help data scientists build and deploy ML infra / data pipelines. Using a complex framework was a burden on our data science team because they had to learn a whole new paradigm to write their python code in, and our engineering team was left with the operational load of helping folks learn Apache Beam / Spark and also managing / deploying production pipelines. From this pain, BuildFlow was born. BuildFlow’s design is based on 2 observations we made at Verily: 1. **The hardest thing to get right is I/O** Efficiently fanning out IO to workers, catching schema mismatches before runtime, and configuring cloud resources is where most of the pain is. BuildFlow abstracts away all of these bits. 2. **Most use cases are large-scale but not overly complex** The existing frameworks give you scalability **and** a complicated programming model that handles every edge case under the sun. BuildFlow provides the same scalability but focuses on common use cases so that you can process your data however you want. ### **How does it work?** When you attach the decorator to your function, the BuildFlow runtime spins up replicas of your processor and wires up everything needed to efficiently scale out the reads from your source and the writes to your sink. This lets you focus on writing logic as opposed to interacting with your external dependencies. The runtime for the BuildFlow is built on top of [ray.io](http://ray.io) so your pipeline can easily scale up to handle any size of workload. ### **Community Asks:** 1. **Try out BuildFlow:** Check out our [docs](https://www.buildflow.dev/docs/intro) and [repo](https://github.com/launchflow/buildflow) to see examples. 2. **Star us on GitHub:** If you’re interested in our project let us know with a star. 3. **Join our **[**discord community**](https://discordapp.com/invite/wz7fjHyrCA)**:** if you would like to say high or just nerd out on data pipelines with us.",Caleb Van Dyke,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/84246d8909c26680215b768c02c3d01d5a7decc2.jpg,Otherimage_27820_1.jpg;,27820
Omnistrate - Cloud platform to SaaSify your open-source project 🚀,"![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70134&key=user_uploads/1159729/250b8d8a-7e84-40d5-80c6-deb4f4645c83) ### **✨ TL;DR** Omnistrate is a control-plane as-a-service that **transforms your docker image into a multi-cloud SaaS service**. Let’s say you have an open-source software (e.g. MongoDB), and you want to monetize your invention by building a multi-cloud SaaS solution (e.g. MongoDB Atlas), you can either spend years doing it yourself, or use Omnistrate to do it in no time. Hello everyone - it’s Kamal and Alok here introducing [Omnistrate](https://www.omnistrate.com)! ### **🤯 Problem** * Going from Software to SaaS can **take months or even years**. Moreover, it can take several attempts for enterprises to find their product-market fit making it **extremely costly** to experiment. * Cloud is **complicated** with so many different services, cloud providers, and a rapidly evolving landscape. * Building a SaaS service from scratch to do undifferentiated heavy-lifting **distracts** enterprise from the core innovation and adds significant **risk** to their business. ### **💡 Solution** * Omnistrate makes it **simple, quick** and **cost-effective**, saving years of development time and resources. And we do this, for every cloud provider across the globe out of the box. * Omnistrate abstracts away all the cloud complexities and make it **super** **easy** to build cloud-native services. * In a fast moving world, enterprises need a platform that allows them to **successfully experiment**, without shifting their focus or taking a massive business risk. ### **📜 Our Story** I was part of the AWS founding team, and built **more than half-a-dozen cloud services** over the years (2007-2020) across different domains. During my early days at AWS, I was one of the **original authors of AWS control plane** that was used to host open-source technologies by numerous AWS services. Alok and I met at AWS Aurora when I was running the database engineering for a **billion dollar SaaS business**, managing millions of databases. Alok was the original technical author of Aurora Serverless, which revolutionized the data systems space. He then went to Cisco to scale networking pipeline (packets-per-second) on AWS by 10-15x. We reunited again at Confluent in 2020 where I ran the Kafka engineering at Confluent and grew their multi-cloud Kafka offering to **200MM+ ARR business managing over 100,000 containers**. Alok played a key role there in scaling Kafka Cloud throughput by 5x, and reducing Kafka Cloud latencies by 10x to really distinguish Confluent Kafka offering from other vendors. With Omnistrate, we want to **share our learnings into a fully automated platform** by getting rid of the undifferentiated work and making it simple for anyone to build a SaaS service. ### **⚒️ How it works** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70134&key=user_uploads/1159729/57ff5a13-a71a-4853-8370-f46493442817) You start by simply bringing your docker image. Omnistrate, from then on, will seamlessly build your SaaS and runs it on auto-pilot. At every step of the process, you retain full control, the ability to innovate on your product and the ability to integrate with your favorite tools or services. ### **🫶 Ask** If you are **looking to SaaSify your open-source (or any other software)**, please sign-up [here](https://omnistrate.com/demo) and we will create an account for you to provide a white glove experience.

For our first customer, we’re projected to generate $2.5M in revenue. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1154826/9d15bcd0-1c04-4706-9da3-35cfdc68bd84) # # **🤯 PROBLEM · MARGIN** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70128&key=user_uploads/1154826/d963c99c-02d2-4450-a2ae-1c089cdfc873) **Doctors (MDs, nurses, therapists) spend less than 50% of their day seeing patients.** Yet you, as a patient, can’t get an appointment 4+ weeks out. Why? … archaic software. **Care models for digital clinics have evolved**. Care happens over calls, texts, at-home, in-person and over state lines covering insurance requirements. Scheduling the supply of doctors with the fluctuating patient demand is too complex for billion-dollar clinics to be coordinating out of spreadsheets. So while demand for healthcare has grown rapidly, **margins are poor**. # **💡 SOLUTION · SAAS** We help clinics improve margins through an all-in-one tool that offers better scheduling, reporting, and forecasting. **Scheduling** to optimize doctors and appointments across specialties, regions, and insurance regulations: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70128&key=user_uploads/1154826/bb5c456b-6bd3-450f-97ef-22ec6b18dd3d) **Reporting**.

CreatorML - ML-Powered Predictive Analytics for YouTube Creators,"Howdy, [**Charles Weill**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cweill/) here! 👋🏼\\ \\ I’m the founder of [**CreatorML**](https://creatorml.com/), a ML-powered web-based tool _and_ Chrome Extension that helps YouTube Creators predict which topics, titles, and thumbnails will get the most views before they upload. For context, prior to June 2022, YouTube paid out over $50B in advertising rev-share to its creators. ### The Problem * Success on YouTube is determined by views, yet creators have no way of quantifying the number of views their videos will receive. * To try and uncover the winning formula, many churn through as many videos as possible and quickly burn out. * YouTubers are drowning in analytics data, but only the largest creators can afford to hire data science teams to get actionable insights. * The biggest determinant of success on YouTube is the quality of topics, titles, and thumbnails. ### Our Solution: * We developed a proprietary machine learning algorithm that analyzes millions of video datapoints to create a reliable, scalable predictive model. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70111&key=user_uploads/11191/7f575fb2-03c9-4d68-9b09-dea25839a408) * Our view predictors allows creators to understand how small changes like reducing the character count of a title, or changing the colors of a thumbnail image can make a meaningful difference in video views. * By removing bias when creators select a title and thumbnail, CreatorML ensures long-form videos are objectively packaged to attract and engage the largest audience possible.  * While CreatorML is starting with topics, titles and thumbnails, our vision is to create a complete predictive ecosystem that guides creators through every step of the creative process. ### The Team * Before founding CreatorML, I was technical lead in applied machine learning at Google Research for 7 years, using deep learning to improve critical algorithms in Cloud AutoML, Ads, Search, and YouTube. * I’m also a part-time [YouTube Creator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjDKKm48cjwdPvM38Kk1_-w). * I realized that I found a pain point when I began [tweeting about simple analyses of YouTube analytics data](https://twitter.com/CharlesWeill/status/1535310836926922752), and many of the biggest YouTubers in the industry began following me. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70111&key=user_uploads/11191/6ad9c037-1b31-4779-89cb-87e65e2a7c97) ### How You Can Help: * Try our demo to get view predictions for channels such as [MrBeast](https://creatorml.com/channels/2563/ranker/), [Aphmau](https://creatorml.com/channels/437/ranker/), and [MKBHD](https://creatorml.com/channels/468/ranker/). * If you’re a YouTube Creator with over 100,000 subscribers, let’s connect at [founders@creatorml.com](mailto:founders@creatorml.com), and I’ll onboard you with a custom view predictor for your channel. * If you’re not a YouTuber, you should download our [Chrome Extension for YouTube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/creatorml-for-youtube/flcnlfhmbofndllkfdnkkbcbopllimfb). It’s totally free, and shows you when YouTubers change their titles and thumbnails, so you can learn what works and what doesn’t for when you begin making your own content: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70111&key=user_uploads/11191/7926c1f9-565e-4732-afef-0162003440e7)",Charles Weill,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/4ae1530922f24f10b74c13bc79afe2ba17da15c1.jpg,Otherimage_27825_1.jpg;Otherimage_27825_2.jpg;Otherimage_27825_3.jpg;,27825
Galaxy 🕹️ - Social multiplayer for games,"**The Problem:** Mobile games are fun for a while, but players get bored quickly (especially when it’s singleplayer) **The Solution:** Competing with friends makes games way more interesting ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70127&key=user_uploads/263116/31b26d16-89c8-4088-80a4-8d47611a6919) Galaxy is a free SDK that adds **community** to any single or multiplayer game (in less than an hour). * _Clans_: Players can create, join, and recruit teams. They compete against other teams and can chat with the group. * _Real Friends_: Players can sync their contacts and easily see/interact with their friends on leaderboards. * _Avatars_: Demonstrating the authenticity of opponents amplifies the feeling of winning. It also provides an optional revenue stream to games who want to sell cosmetics. * _Powerful Leaderboards:_ Configure & manage leaderboards from a dashboard. Set up automatic prizes, repeating tournaments, ban users, customize UI, and more. Players love it. Session length increases by \\~1m55s and D7 retention rises by as much as 37%. Additionally, teams encourage players to invite their friends who don’t already play the game - leading to free user growth as well. Here’s a graph from one of our customers after they added Clan leaderboards: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70127&key=user_uploads/263116/a21e9395-7c8f-4bdd-b6bf-48c1949b33a9) But what about implementation?

Sirdab - Cloud warehousing & transportation services in MENA,"**👋 Hi everyone, we are Naif & Abdulrahman from Sirdab.** **TL;DR:** Sirdab makes it easy for businesses to acquire dry, ambient, chilled and frozen warehousing space and hire fleets to move inventory through a single dashboard. Today, we manage over 50 warehouses, totaling 400k square meters of space, in 8 cities in Saudi Arabia.  **❌ Problem – Storing and moving inventory in MENA is challenging**   **1\\. Difficulty in finding suitable solutions:** The conventional approach for businesses is to rent, equip, and operate their own warehouses. The available options are often difficult to discover online and frequently surpass the actual space needs for the business, resulting in underutilized facilities. On the other hand, businesses seeking third-party logistics (3PL) services face a similar challenge in locating a reliable and trustworthy partner. **2\\. Lack of short-term options:** Regardless of whether a business opts to rent its own warehouse or utilize a third-party logistics provider, it will likely be bound by long-term agreements with limited flexibility. **3\\. Inefficient inventory management:** As businesses grow, managing inventory across multiple locations becomes increasingly complex and inefficient. Unfortunately, many businesses still resort to using spreadsheet-based methods to manage inventory, lacking a clear record of their inbound and outbound transactions. **4\\. Challenges in inventory distribution:** For both wholesale and store distribution in Saudi, businesses often face the dilemma of either committing to lengthy contracts or operating their own fleets with subpar utilization efficiency. **✨ Solution – Hassle-free cloud warehousing & transportation through one platform 🚛** **1\\. Variety of warehousing space options:** Quickly find and secure dry, ambient, chilled and frozen warehousing space across 8 cities in MENA within 48 hours, for any space you need, starting with 10 square meters. **2\\. Flexible short-term contracts:** Whether you need the space for a month or a year, we got you covered. Our contracts include options for month-to-month, 6-month, and 12-month durations. **3\\. Streamlined inventory management:** Have a 360-degree view on your inventory list, track all historical movements, analyze consumption and get notified on shortages.  **4\\. Wide-ranging transportation offerings:** Access a range of FTL, LTL freight offerings as well as parcel and last-mile carriers for store distribution.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70086&key=user_uploads/456006/6865d6e7-e9e0-425f-8a92-a473933dbaea) **💵 Bottom line impact based on traction:**  **Warehousing cost for merchants:** Based on 80+ active clients, Sirdab customers see an average reduction in warehousing costs by 27%.  **Transportation for merchants:** Aside from enhancing delivery times & quality, Sirdab customers have experienced an average decrease in their bulk and last-mile transportation expenses by 12%. **Warehousing operations for partners:** Along with boosting income and maximizing use of space, our partners are able to streamline their operations, monitor the time needed for order preparation, and have automated billing processes.  **🤝 Quick Ask** * Spread the word! * Follow our journey on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/usesirdab/) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/usesirdab?lang=en) * If you currently work with a 3PL in the region, or need warehousing space, we would love to chat with you or the appropriate person at your company.

Trackstar – Plaid for supply chain logistics,"### **TL;DR Supply chain logistics is an $11 trillion global industry that is still in the early innings of digitization. Trackstar’s universal API lets software companies integrate with any warehouse management system in hours, not months.** Hi everyone 👋, we’re [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-langer-84846548/) and [Jeremy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-schneck-a67b5479/) from Trackstar! We are on a mission to digitize the global supply chain – one API at a time. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1155870/53fd0b5a-6777-4d6c-94e5-a8057c816dad) ### 🩺**The Problem** Innovation in the supply chain industry is stifled by the lack of accessible data. For example, there are hundreds of warehouse management systems, most of which are legacy tools with poorly documented APIs or no APIs at all. Companies that work on inventory planning, supply chain visibility, product returns, financing, warehouse operations, and more, are forced to build, maintain, and normalize data across one-off supply chain integrations.  These companies… * **Drain time and resources** trying to integrate with enough of the WMS market; * **Miss out on winning new business** by not supporting integrations that their customers need; * **Or never start** because the integration hurdle prevents them from even entering the market. ### 💡**Our Solution** A universal API for the global supply chain. Our API for warehouse management systems lets software companies build once against a single API and instantly read and write data from any WMS.  WMS is just the beginning. Digitizing these systems will enable a wave of existing and new SaaS companies to build a more efficient and sustainable supply chain. ### **📜How It Works** With our universal API, companies can offer WMS integrations without the dev work, and focus their time and resources on their core product. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1155870/7e55987e-cc1c-44f7-a7be-d2ab21e3d1da) ### ⚡**Asks** If you know any companies that currently integrate with or are looking to integrate with WMS, please send intros to [founders@trackstarhq.com](mailto:founders@trackstarhq.com).

Free** [**Sign up**](https://detector.inboxbooster.com/accounts/signup/) ### **My newsletter is in promotion** Have you ever had that problem? Have you ever had your business revenue drops because of spam placements? Do you dread the promotion tab? ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70040&key=user_uploads/126917/27d19339-a345-4256-840e-5faaa2f3ced6) If this ever happened to you, you’ll love us. We’re fixing this email problem once and for all. Inboxbooster fixes email in spam and promotion. ### **Why are you in spam?** Senders are in spam for a combination of: * **Incorrect Email DNS Setup**. The keywords are DKIM, SPF, and DMARC. * **Bad Reputation**. Mailbox providers score IPs and domains from their past behavior. * **Content Filter**, the content of your emails triggers the filters. Usually, the root cause is a combination of these factors, and they compound. For instance, your DMARC is wrongly set up and triggers Gmail to send all your emails to spam. Because nobody is marking the email as \""not spam,\"" Gmail decides that your email is spam. Now your domain and your content have a bad reputation. You fixed your DMARC, but your emails are still going to spam because of what happened. ### **How does Inboxbooster fix spam placements?** Spam filters work by scoring how people interact with your emails. Once in spam, your emails are interacted with much less. Hence they tend to stay in spam. This is this vicious cycle that Inboxbooster breaks. We resolve this quandary by identifying the elements in your email triggering the spam filter and the root cause. The first step is to send us your email: we’ll tell you where you’re in spam, promotion, and if you have any DNS issues. This is free. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70040&key=user_uploads/126917/4410a7b2-816a-4fb6-8f82-1e58aee86ca4) Then we’ll build a step-by-step solution guide with the root cause, the short-term fix, and the long-term fix. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70040&key=user_uploads/126917/ecec4fc4-4ade-403f-b097-991093fc528b) Also, we love talking to you, so please [book some chat time with us](https://calendly.com/inboxbooster/inboxbooster-onboarding?). ### **About Us** We, [Nicolas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas/) and [Marcus,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ehsmeng/) built this product.

Hadrius - SEC regulatory compliance powered by AI,"Hey everyone - we’re [Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasjstewart/), [Allen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/androidallen/), and [Som](https://www.linkedin.com/in/som-mohapatra/) from [Hadrius](https://www.hadrius.com). Hadrius automates the entire ongoing SEC compliance process for investment managers, saving compliance teams hours daily on manual reviews, filings, and audit prep while giving full control over tasks and flagged items from an intuitive dashboard. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70075&key=user_uploads/441787/94685246-2441-4db1-8194-bece9149c302) ### **The Problem ❌** 30,000+ financial firms spend a combined total of $16b+ a year on ongoing SEC compliance, and with new regulations every year, these costs are continuing to rise. At the same time, the existing solutions can hardly keep up, with most firms paying for third-party consultants, law firms, and 2-decade-old software - while still relying on endless manual work to make up the gap. The result: upwards of $10k/year per employee spent on regulatory compliance and thousands of hours of tedious tasks at each financial firm. ### **The Solution ✨** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70075&key=user_uploads/441787/5a1b6f89-e106-431d-b8d0-500788a169be)   Hadrius scans emails, slack and SMS with GPT3, flagging non-compliant language to speed up correspondence review and does similar work for marketing review and regular filings. We’ve also automated billing reviews, allocation reviews, and rollovers by integrating into investment managers’ existing compliance stack (like client CRMs and trading systems). All this is presented to the CCO and their compliance team as a dashboard where they can manage the automated tasks and review flagged items that require human input - overall savings hours daily. ### **Why Us 🤝** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70075&key=user_uploads/441787/2991c0e1-d02d-43a0-a161-499a3b680426) We ran an SEC-registered RIA ourselves, we've faced these challenges firsthand and developed Hadrius for our own fully-automated compliance program. We aim for a world where compliance is the effortless state of financial firms, rather than constant worry requiring expensive vigilance to maintain. Across the team, we’ve had 1 previous exit and worked at Google, hedge funds, and Chime. ### **Launch Deal 🙏** If you’re an asset manager, we’ll begin automating your entire compliance stack with 20% off our annual contract as an early bird discount.

Gloo: Empower LLM’s with domain-specific knowledge,"**tl;dr** LLMs are awesome, but they have no knowledge about your data, and when you give it to them, they’re prone to make stuff up. We help developers build a searchable knowledgebase that LLMs can understand, and validate their responses are legit. Hey everyone! We’re Aaron and Vaibhav from Gloo and we’re on a mission to help LLMs understand your data and get them to stop hallucinating all over the place. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70071&key=user_uploads/855521/fefa49cf-6a22-4913-ac9e-da9550da9e69) ### **The problem** Building a knowledge graph isn’t as easy as calling OpenAI embeddings API, storing them in a VectorDB and calling it a day. Developers have to choose from a myriad of parameters like chunking algorithm, embedding type (even based on the content), vectorDB, whether to fine-tune or not, how to securely store the data — and the list goes on and on. Once you feed everything into the LLM, you’re only halfway there, as getting rid of hallucinations is tricky, and confidently incorrect answers to customer questions will give you headaches in the long-term. On top of that, you still have your actual customer problems to still fix: getting the customer data, building flows on top of the LLM, writing the right prompts, getting more customers. ### **The solution** Gloo is the managed solution to building your knowledge graph — built for LLM context-windows from the ground-up. **We stand up a search API for your data that supports both keyword and semantic search**, and we smartly index and compute embeddings for you based on the content type. Once that’s setup, you can call our **_Check-_GPT API to check LLM answers** against your knowledgebase to ensure trustworthiness. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70071&key=user_uploads/855521/4c3b7bd2-6924-427b-a1f6-6aa194ae500f) We built our search with a security-first approach. Your data is always server-side encrypted, and never actually stored in 3rd party Vector DBs.

Palomma 🕊️ - Frictionless Pay by Bank for LatAm,"**TLDR** [Palomma](https://www.palomma.com/) helps online merchants and apps in LatAm save 70-80% on card processing fees and increase conversions, by enabling frictionless Pay by Bank for their customers (consumers and/or businesses). **The problem** 1. Receiving card payments is expensive for merchants, it costs them between 2 to 5% per transaction 2. Receiving the cheaper alternative, Pay by Bank, poses several frictions: 1. **Low conversion:** multiple steps are required to checkout via existing Pay by Bank solutions, resulting in a \\~40% failure rate 2. **Non-recurrent:** different from cards, existing Pay by Bank alternatives are hard to enable for recurring payments, requiring complex direct integrations with local banks 3. **Confirmation:** confirming a bank payment requires checking bank accounts in real-time, or trusting the proof of confirmation sent by the customer (fraud-prone) 4. **Reconciliation:** existing Pay by Bank data is cryptic: i.e., “68068407595”, making reconciliation difficult **The solution:** A single API and platform that allows online merchants or apps across LatAm (starting with Colombia) to receive frictionless Pay by Bank payments [Demo](https://youtu.be/wgoOIsv_47k) 1. **Higher conversion:** 30-40% more conversion with frictionless Pay by Bank 2. **Recurrent:** easily enable recurrent Pay by Bank payments 3. **Confirmation:** allow your employees to instantly confirm bank payments via our dashboard and WhatsApp / email notifications 4. **Easy reconciliation:** clearly identify each Pay by Bank payment in our dashboard ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70053&key=user_uploads/981886/c6212d2c-0c67-4542-a1d7-0e4973f1567d) _PD: we´re also working on frictionless cash-out bank payments through our API & platform ;) 🔜_ **Why are we building this?** During his time at Nubank, [Cipriano](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cipriano-echavarria-3729a9105/) personally saw the pain experienced by online merchants and apps with high card processing fees, and the friction around the cheaper, Pay by Bank alternatives.\\ \\ With [Pipe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipemon/) & [Nico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ngomezdelcampo/)´s tech, we´re changing that 🕊️ **The ask:** 1.

🚀 Clueso : Create in-app tours that never go out-of-date,"Hey there! We’re [Prajwal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prajwalprakash2000), [Neel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neelbalar7/), and [Akash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/theakashanand), and we are very excited to launch [Clueso](https://clueso.io) to all of you! **TL;DR:** Clueso helps customer success teams save time creating and maintaining help content for SaaS apps. Our product converts simple screen recordings of product features into interactive product tours and how-to guides that stay up-to-date with every product release.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70052&key=user_uploads/1159730/adc0642c-6d2c-44cd-b4e3-7e18691a78fe) ### [**🔴**](https://emojipedia.org/large-red-circle/) **The Problem** Users of SaaS apps have a hard time discovering new features and finding what they’re looking for, even on products with a well-designed UX. Creating help guides on tools like Intercom is time-consuming – you have to put together screenshots, write out instructions, and make everything look presentable. Making interactive tours is even more work. And what happens when you deploy new UI updates? All your hard work goes down the drain, and you have to start from scratch. ### [**🟢**](https://emojipedia.org/large-green-circle/) **Our Solution** Clueso lets you create help guides for product features in seconds rather than hours. Here’s how it works: **Step 1:**  Use our chrome extension to capture a simple screen recording of some feature on your app.  **Step 2:** That’s it; you’re done!  Clueso automatically generates help guides in three formats: a document with screenshots, a video, and an interactive tour that points users to the exact buttons they need to click on your app. **Wanna see it in action?** Check out this 2-min demo: [Clueso Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/964797a5cf6c4582b5ffb5ccca662abf) To serve all these guides to your users, **insert a single line of code** to add our help widget to your app. Your users’ experience looks something like this: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70052&key=user_uploads/1159730/182a84cf-6ce7-4f5b-aa2f-695a47b208a8) ### 🤯 **But wait, there’s more!** No more waiting for angry customers to come tell you your docs are out of date! With every new update on your app, all guides are automatically tested. Outdated guides are flagged so that you know exactly which ones need to be reworked. ### **Meet the team** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70052&key=user_uploads/1159730/f606bc26-46b2-4218-af78-465829b49618) We’re a team of recent grads from IIT Madras. Before Clueso, our team built and scaled [Desklamp](https://desklamp.io) – a note-taking tool for students and researchers – to 2k MAU from around the world. We experienced this problem first-hand with Desklamp, where our users would repeatedly email us similar questions about how to use the product. Prajwal (middle) has a bachelor’s in Computer Science, while Neel (left) and Akash (right) have a bachelor’s in Engineering Design and a master’s in Data Science.  ### **Our Ask** * If you’d like to give your users an interactive way to learn your app or discover new features, reach out to us at [founders@clueso.io](mailto:founders@clueso.io) or schedule a chat with us here: [calendly link](https://calendly.com/clueso/30min?month=2023-03). * If you know of someone else who may be interested, especially customer success managers at seed-stage+ start-ups, we’d love an intro!",Akash Anand,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/61327c80321119ca51d5814b819ea1ec687bc662.jpg,Otherimage_27982_1.jpg;Otherimage_27982_2.jpg;Otherimage_27982_3.jpg;,27982
Stralis 🛫 - Emission free hydrogen electric aircraft,"Hi! We’re [Bob](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobcriner/) & [Stuart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuartjohnstone1/) from [Stralis Aircraft](https://stralis.aero/) in Australia. We make emission free hydrogen electric aircraft to help decarbonise air travel. We have $50M in LOIs for our launch product, a 15 seat aircraft with a range of 800 km that enters service in 2026 [with launch customer Skytrans](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/30/queensland-airline-skytrans-unveils-plans-for-australias-first-hydrogen-fuelled-plane). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70037&key=user_uploads/1205655/4a8710bf-c888-40cf-9f99-5e2f9c82b9ce) **Ask:** 🙏 Intros to airlines or aircraft operators that might be interested in our products would be greatly appreciated. Contact: [bc@stralis.aero](mailto:bc@stralis.aero) **Problem - Alternatives Compromise on Range or Cost** As other modes of transport decarbonise, aviation’s contribution to global emissions will increase. Based on our first hand experience, we believe other sustainable flight alternatives compromise on: * Battery Electric - limited range & payload * Hybrid Electric - expensive to operate, limited emission reduction * Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) - expensive & emits other harmful pollutants (NOx, sulphates, particulates) **Solution - Hydrogen Electric Propulsion** We're convinced hydrogen electric is the cheapest way to rapidly decarbonise 50% of commercial flights. * How it works - Green hydrogen and air are combined in a fuel cell stack to produce electric power, which is used by an electric motor to turn a propeller. The only thing emitted during this process is water. * Our proprietary hydrogen electric propulsion system is 35% lighter than the competition, unlocking useful aircraft ranges at low cost. * Our first product is a retrofit of an already certified aircraft, allowing us to get to market quicker and cheaper. * We plan to deliver 50,000 of our 48 seat SA-1 aircraft by 2050, generating $850B in revenue. **Our Backstory** We met in 2017 at [magniX](https://www.magnix.aero/), leading teams developing electric aircraft propulsion systems for the world’s first battery powered eBeaver and eCaravan flights. The Stralis team has 85 years of aerospace experience, having developed, flight tested and certified aircraft at GoogleX, [Heart Aerospace (YC W19)](https://heartaerospace.com/), [Ampaire](https://www.ampaire.com/), Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier and Gulfstream. Now we’re on a mission to make Stralis the world’s leading emission free aircraft company.

Paperplane - Automatically update Salesforce after sales calls using NLP.,"**TLDR**: ✈️ [**Paperplane**](https://www.paperplane.ai/) **automatically updates Salesforce after sales calls. Sales teams at fast-growing B2B companies do 14%+ more calls per week because they no longer have to spend hours updating their CRM.** ![](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/media/?type=post&id=70012&key=user_uploads/312272/108c66cb-2f3c-4a62-865b-c88b96f03b74) ### **The Problem:** There are over **3 million** B2B salespeople in the US, and each of them spends 3-6 hours each week manually updating their CRM with data about their customers and live deals.  This creates a problem at every layer of large and fast-moving sales teams. Reps at companies like Nextdoor, Twilio, Checkr, and Front spend **10-15% of their time** on data entry versus actually selling; Sales leaders spend hours chasing reps for updates; and sales-ops / rev-ops teams deal with their **CRM missing \\~50% of opportunity data**. This has always made it difficult for sales teams to know what is really happening and which deals are at risk. In an environment where many B2B companies have to do more with less, something has to give. ### **Our Solution:** **Paperplane solves this problem by automatically updating Salesforce after every sales call.**  We plug into a sales team’s conversational intelligence platform (e.g. Gong, Chorus, Wingman) and Salesforce. After the call, Paperplane transcribes and extracts the required Salesforce fields (eg. next steps, follow-ups, pain points, MEDDIC) and notes. No keywords, tracking words, or scripts to adhere to. Paperplane’s NLP model is built to retrieve the correct data regardless of phrasing and is grounded to mitigate hallucinations that are common with language models today. ![Paperplane application dashboard](https://assets.website-files.com/61dda3a6f044ba05c5199801/63c85e1f69303cf09805823d_PIc%203.svg) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70012&key=user_uploads/312272/b1a55bb7-eba1-42d4-b245-fcbc8dd9e1c8) Once done, sales leaders get the updates and notes they need in minutes and reps no longer spend hours moving data from their notes into Salesforce. We’re currently working with a handful of fast-growing B2B companies to increase their pipeline visibility, improve sales productivity, and help them understand why they’re winning/losing. ## **Our Ask 🙏** 1. If you’re interested in a pilot, please email us at [founders@paperplane.ai](mailto:founders@paperplane.ai). 2.

Lume - No-code tool to create and maintain custom data integrations,"**TL;DR** Lume helps engineering teams build and maintain custom data integrations with no code. If you spend countless hours manually transforming data for custom integrations, we can help! Please go to our [website](https://www.lume-ai.com) and sign up for our private beta. —- --- Hi everyone! We are Nicolas, Nebyou, and Robert, the founders of Lume. We are on a mission to empower companies to focus on delivering their core value proposition rather than spending time on data integrations and transformations.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70009&key=user_uploads/1157038/0a606e9a-7357-4f36-bd06-be63bddcd635) **🧨 Problem**  Engineers spend countless hours manually transforming data for custom integrations or pay large amounts to consulting firms to do the same. Dynamic schemas from different clients or apps require engineers to build and maintain custom integration pipelines one by one, and companies spend days, weeks, and even months building integrations. Lume is tackling this problem head-on.  **✨ Solution** Lume uses AI to automatically transform data between _any_ start and end schema and pipes the data directly to your desired destination. Lume provides this through a no-code platform where you can build and maintain your custom data integrations. Whether you want to map multiple sources to your internal unified schema or connect to your third-party apps without manual mapping, Lume delivers. With automated transformations and data delivery, backtesting and data quality checks, and version control, engineers can spend more time delivering their core value to customers instead of wrangling and manually mapping data.  **⚙️ How it works** * You connect your custom schemas and authenticate into your desired apps. * Lume’s AI system creates the transformations between any two schemas, ranging from internal schemas to structured third-party apps. * Once you validate the transformed data, Lume will pipe the correct data to your specified destination. We can connect to your data warehouse and leverage its compute to keep your data in-house. **Common Use Cases:** * Internal: Transforming separate data sources into one unified internal ontology * Ex: a unified schema between Salesforce, Hubspot, Quickbooks, and Pipedrive. * External: Custom syncs between your SaaS apps * Ex: Enrich CRM data from multiple sources before sending it to your BI tool * Onboarding: Mapping prospective client data to fit your product’s input schema * Ex: Consulting firms mapping each new clients’ unique ERP schemas to their internal ontology on Snowflake. * Migration: Creating custom integration pipelines between competitor products to yours  * Ex: New productivity tool startup creates an “Import from Notion/Evernote” for newly converted users. **👨‍💻Meet the Team** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=70009&key=user_uploads/1157038/86b2a6a9-5fb4-4300-be17-30125bdb80fa) My co-founders Nicolas Machado (right), Nebyou Zewde (middle), and I (left) all met during our first year at Stanford, where we received our undergraduate and Master's degrees in computer science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.

🧪 ⚛️ Diffuse Bio: Generative AI for protein design,"Hi 👋🏾 I’m Namrata, founder of ⚛️⚛️⚛️ **Diffuse Bio!** ⚛️⚛️⚛️ At Diffuse, we computationally design therapeutics, vaccines, and enzymes better, faster, and cheaper — but most importantly, we generate **molecules that simply can’t be designed with existing methods today**. ### The Problem: Proteins are macromolecules that mediate a significant fraction of the cellular processes that underlie life. An important task in bioengineering is designing proteins with specific 3D structures and chemical properties which enable targeted functions.  So far, computational protein design methods have had some success — but have enormous limitations, the primary one being **low success in downstream validation experiments**. These methods are also painfully slow and scale poorly. ### What we do: For the past several years, I’ve been working on **re-envisioning the computational protein design toolkit with AI** in my PhD and beyond, with the goal of overcoming these challenges.

😎☀️ Coperniq — Workflow software for solar & energy contractors,"What’s up YC 👻 , Max & Abdullah here - co-founders of [Coperniq](https://www.coperniq.io/) (W23). # **🏃‍♂️ TL;DR** Coperniq is workflow software for solar & energy contractors. It cuts soft cost per installation by **$3K (17% of total cost)** & accelerates projects by **45 days (30% of project timeline)**. It automates the entire workflow so contractors can focus on growing their business & helping more homeowners go solar 😎☀️ # **🤯 Problem** Abdullah used to work in the solar industry, first in the sales department, and later in operations management. He witnessed first-hand that while **“going solar”** was a no-brainer and took consumers 5 minutes, the process of getting a solar system **turned on** was a nightmare for companies and customers alike, taking 6-9 months instead of the promised 90 days. \\ \\ This is because despite being one of the most important industries of our lifetime, solar is in the dark ages technologically. Bloated Salesforce instances, spreadsheets with 300+ columns, and pencil-and-paper workflows in the field… This results in project managers working 60-hour weeks, human error & delays at every step of the process, and some of the [worst customer experience](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1877039252445470) in the entire home improvement sector. # **💡 Solution** Coperniq is the first industry-specific platform for the underserved energy workforce. It helps… ## **1\\. Finish projects faster and cheaper** Our platform cuts up to 25% of soft costs, allowing contractors to deploy more projects, faster, and cheaper; with 5-star customer experience **every time**. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69996&key=user_uploads/541919/dc586ac8-2cc9-4216-a3ff-95737f8c9942) ### **2\\.

Pledge Health - Automated patient billing for healthcare clinics,"Hi! We’re Shreya and Andrew, the team behind [Pledge Health](https://www.pledge.health/?utm_source=launch_yc&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=launch_yc). **TL;DR** Pledge automates patient billing for independent healthcare clinics. We estimate how much insurance will cover for each visit, so clinics can charge patients at the time of service, rather than waiting weeks for insurance to process. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69977&key=user_uploads/632299/dfd59475-c145-471f-966b-d69acf3819ef) ### 🤯  **The Problem** A larger share of healthcare clinics’ revenue is coming from patients instead of insurance companies, so clinics are trying to charge patients upfront for care. However, the manual process of estimating how much a patient will pay after insurance is error-prone, expensive, and time-consuming. Take Dr. Emily for example; she **spends more than 20 cents to collect every $1 from a patient**. Despite the high cost and effort, her office is only able to collect 50% of the patient's responsibility at the time of the visit. There are over 200k clinic owners like Dr. Emily in the US, **struggling to collect $47 billion in patient payments** every year. ### 💡 **Our Solution** * Automatically verifies patient insurance benefits ahead of their appointment. * Creates personalized out-of-pocket cost estimates by combining the patient’s insurance benefits, the predicted services for the visit, and contracted prices. * Communicates the estimated cost and final bills clearly with patients via email and text and allows patients to schedule payments. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69977&key=user_uploads/632299/e1fa730d-526f-440b-99b8-53fc81ffa657) 📈 Results with Pledge * Reduce time spent on collecting patient responsibility by 75% * Increase collections by 17% * See > 90% patient satisfaction ### 🤠 **Team** Andrew was a founding engineer at CancerIQ, where he built integrations with electronic health record systems that are crucial to automating billing workflows at Pledge. Shreya was a software engineer at Microsoft, where she worked on healthcare and ML applications. ### 🫶 **Our Ask** Are you a digital health company or know someone who owns/works at a private healthcare practice that accepts insurance? **Please connect with us at **[**engage@pledge.health**](mailto:engage@pledge.health)**!** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69977&key=user_uploads/632299/b78a4d89-22e0-40dd-bed0-1fdd421c39e8)",Shreya Jagarlamudi,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/7836a61520170bacf1d801ee9a49f00ccf77753a.jpg,Otherimage_27785_1.jpg;Otherimage_27785_2.jpg;Otherimage_27785_3.jpg;,27785
🚀 Syncly — AI customer feedback analytics that drives retention,"Hey, We are Joseph, Kwan, Jongsoo from [Syncly](https://www.syncly.app) (YC W23). Our team founded and sold an AI startup for $200M, and decided to bring our technology to help Revenue team drive retention by delivering the right value for customers. ### **TL;DR** Syncly uses AI and Chat-GPT to enable Revenue teams to better understand customer insights to drive retention and team productivity. ### **The Challenge** * **Manual tagging and insights:** Your revenue team wants to understand the most impactful product or operational feedback, but the team spend a lot of time manually aggregating and analyzing. As a result, you come to learn what had gone wrong _AFTER_ the damage. * **Measuring team efficiency**: Hard to track most of what problems your Revenue team is doing, but seems your team is doing a lot. Currently, done by 1-on-1 meetings or manual tagging, which is not scalable. * **Post-action impact:** Hard to measure how customer feedback has changed after certain actions. ### **The Solution** * **Automating feedback insight:** Syncly finds urgent and impactful customer issues. Your team can proactively engage with customers _BEFORE_ the damage. * **Boosting team efficiency:** Spread best practices within the organization to help Account managers, Customer success & support managers focus on delivering more value to the customer. * **Post-action visibility:** By monitoring customer feedback trend, you can measure the impact of each release and action. \\*Syncly’s integrations include **Intercom, Slack, Salesforce**, and other customer communication platforms. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/971454/777aa42c-a17a-40a9-8418-feaf2f342c4d) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/971454/ab5abf25-c974-4eed-8e29-1f07e7bff28c) ### **Our Asks** * If you wanted to get as many actional insights from your customers feedback, schedule a call with us here: [https://www.syncly.app](https://www.syncly.app/) (Click “Book a Demo”) * Feel free to shoot me an email at [joseph@deepbluedot.io](mailto:joseph@deepbluedot.io) if you want to chat more.",Joseph Lee,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/75a88e5da60f459d1d0d88876593bd0988f7b1fd.jpg,Otherimage_27685_1.jpg;Otherimage_27685_2.jpg;,27685
Thread - Incident management for large enterprises,"Hi everyone! We’re Yuheng, Akeem, and Harsha, the co-founders of Thread. **tldr: Thread is incident management for large enterprises. We take the best practices from Amazon and Microsoft and make them available to all engineering organizations.** ### **Problem ❌:** Incidents are the most stressful part of any live production service, and engineers are often ill-prepared for dealing with them… especially in large enterprises. As enterprises move to the cloud and microservice architecture, embrace remote work, and pick up increasingly more tooling for incidents, engineers face growing difficulty identifying and resolving complex system issues. * APMs, such as Datadog and New Relic, **overwhelm engineers with data and lack contextual information, making problem-solving a challenge.** * Customer support help desks, like Zendesk, **often provide inadequate information when creating tickets, leading to a frustrating cycle of questions for engineers.** * Alerting and ITSM tools, such as Pagerduty and ServiceNow, **alert engineering teams but often lack the necessary context for efficient issue resolution.** Not to mention, leadership still lacks visibility into incident details and progression. It's like trying to solve a puzzle with missing pieces and no picture on the box. ### **Solution 💡:** The gold standard for incident management workflows is straightforward to describe, but it is incredibly difficult to implement in practice, especially at enterprise scale. The four pillars are: **Detection**: identifying the bug using either a monitoring tool or a customer service tool **Routing**: getting the ticket to the right person that can solve the issue, using paging tools and communication tools **Resolution**: using context-providing tools like session replays and streamlined data providers to help solve the issue **Learning**: identifying the root cause of the issue and generating future workflows to more adeptly solve the problem (or prevent it from happening again) Enter **Thread:** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69972&key=user_uploads/1146884/e2dd7ee3-17c8-45d5-a047-eb5305106c76) Thread offers engineers a customized configuration management database with runbooks, past tickets, monitoring data, and recommended actions for diagnosing and resolving incidents. We also provide real-time updates and summaries to leadership and stakeholders during critical incidents, identifying bottlenecks in workflows to prevent future issues. Why settle for a single tool that might not fit all your needs? Our platform allows teams to bring in their favorite tools to create a tailor-made solution. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69972&key=user_uploads/1146884/417624ff-51f1-426f-93ef-8c792f1758f7) ### **Why us?** We’re 3 ex-Microsoft/Amazon engineers who built these tools and processes on our respective teams (Microsoft Store and Prime Video). We want to take what we learned and build an even better solution for the millions of engineers out there, so no one has to face the existential dread of on-call panic ever again. ### **Our Ask ❤️:** If you or anyone in your network knows a VP/Director of Engineering at a large enterprise, around fortune 500 level, (**bonus points if their org currently uses tools like ServiceNow**) who would be open to using a 3rd party tool to improve their incident management, processes, and/or learnings, **we’d love an intro.** If you have enterprise-level experience with **any of the above tools, we want to hear from you!** We're always striving to improve our integrations and bridge any gaps in the incident management process.

⚡ Planar - Add 10x features to GitHub code review,"[Planar](https://www.useplanar.com) is a chrome extension that adds 10X features to GitHub code review. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69966&key=user_uploads/979098/831d48f8-045d-4ab1-bd3d-8d0f223b28fb) Viraj and I were both engineers at Meta and we realized that GitHub is lacking a lot of the features we used to use to be 10x more productive. So we added them to GitHub. The features include: * A new review page UX that uses AI to group together related changes in a large PR * A layout that puts comments side by side with code * An inbox that shows you which PRs need your review across all your repos * Notifications that trigger whenever an update to a PR requires your attention With more features coming soon … * The ability to easily view and navigate stacked PRs * Streamlined PR conversations * A visual dependency graph that shows you how all the files and components in your PR are connected We also know that we are inundated with new tools. That’s why we designed these features in a chrome extension so that you don’t have to onboard onto a new tool. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69966&key=user_uploads/979098/da142f48-acfb-4107-b66e-cca57b49343a) **Problem** A bit more about the problem. Code review is hard because * For most developers on a team, there is insufficient context to leave a good review * Review communication is really noisy. Most teams are relying on noisy slack channels to know which PRs they need to look at. * Most teams work hard to develop a culture of small PRs because long PRs are miserable to review. But they’re also inevitable. The features listed above aim to make this time-consuming workflow way faster and easier, so that you can ship faster with less tech debt. **Ask YC:** Try the extension and let us know what you think at [hello@useplanar.com](mailto:hello@useplanar.com).",Eshan Agarwal,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/73ce68b7ea791a3f34d19fd1c49fb6134973224a.jpg,Otherimage_28071_1.jpg;Otherimage_28071_2.jpg;,28071
⚡🔍 Sherloq: Collaborate and manage your SQL data with the power of Gen AI,"**TL;DR** Sherloq is a collaborative SQL repository, like Github for data teams, that creates one source of truth for all company queries using Gen AI.

Flower: Train AI on distributed data,"Hi everyone - we're Daniel, Taner, and Nic, and we're excited to introduce [Flower](https://flower.dev/?utm_source=yc&utm_medium=tagline&utm_campaign=yclaunch): **TL;DR 🌼 Flower is an open-source framework for training AI on distributed data using federated learning. Companies like Brave, Banking Circle, and Nokia use us to improve their models with sensitive data that they could not leverage before.** → Before you continue: [give us a star on GitHub](https://github.com/adap/flower) ⭐️ ### Problem: What's holding AI back? Almost all of the AI breakthroughs you know of — from ChatGPT and Google Translate to DALL·E and Stable Diffusion — were trained with public data available on the web. **Conventional machine learning needs all data collected in a central place, the motto has always been to “move the data to the computation**.**”** This approach has given us some impressive results, but we are seeing those advances struggle to make their way into other important areas, like healthcare. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/433179/d7d5559b-1a93-43ee-8b87-79472c59b0bb) Why is that? The reason is simple: most data is sensitive and distributed across organizational silos or user devices. It cannot be collected in a central place, which prevents us from training state-of-the-art models for many important use cases: * **👩‍🎨 Generative AI:** Many scenarios require sensitive data that users or organizations are reluctant to upload to the cloud. * **❤️‍🩹 Healthcare:** We have excellent AI model architectures, and we could train cancer detection models better than any doctor in the world, but no single organization has enough data * **🏦 Finance:** Preventing financial fraud is hard because individual banks face data regulations, and in isolation, they don't have enough fraud cases to train good models * **🏎️ Automotive:** Autonomous driving could transform our lives, but, again, individual car makers struggle to gather the data to cover the long tail of possible edge cases * **💻 Personal computing:** Users don't want certain kinds of data to be stored in the cloud, hence the recent success of privacy-enhancing alternatives like the Signal messenger or the Brave browser * **📚 Foundation models:** The more and the more diverse data we have to train foundation models, the better they generalize. But again, most data is sensitive and thus can't be incorporated as these models continue to grow bigger and need more information. ### Solution: Federated learning (and other PETs) **Federated learning can train AI models on distributed and sensitive data by moving the training to the data (instead of moving the data to the training); it just collects the insights from the learning process, and the data stays where it is.** And because the data never moves, we can train AI on sensitive data spread across organizational silos or user devices to improve models with data that could never be leveraged until now. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/433179/75358693-c54c-4e64-ae5a-25af3c70a8f8) This is, of course, more challenging: we must move AI models to data silos or user devices, train locally, send updated models back, aggregate them, and repeat. **Flower provides the open-source infrastructure to easily use federated learning (and other privacy-enhancing technologies - or short: PETs) with all the tools you know and love today - PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging Face, fastai, Weights & Biases - just bring your existing project, and easily “federate” it using Flower.** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/433179/90196c7c-dddb-4b48-9d54-d9d6689b60c0) ### Asks: How can you help? * [Give us a star on GitHub](https://github.com/adap/flower) ⭐️ (if you haven't done so already) * **Are you (or someone you know) facing challenges in getting the data you need to train good AI models?

Dream3D 😈 - AI-powered 3D design,"Hey, y’all! Tony here from Dream3D– excited to share what Justin and I have been working on! **Dream3D is an AI-powered 3D design tool that makes it easy to create studio-quality computer graphics.** ### The Problem **Creating 3D renders is an expensive and time-consuming process that can take teams of highly trained specialists months, if not years, to produce a final result.** In current rendering methods, input quality = output quality. A designer or artist needs to spend days building a scene, component by component, to get a final rendered result.  **This leads to** * 🐢 Slow and costly iteration cycles as you nail down your creative vision * 💰 Hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars spent purchasing assets, textures, and shaders– many of which never even make the final cut * 🤬 Complex and difficult-to-use tools required for building detailed scenes ### How we fix this **Dream3D replaces complex workflows with text-driven commands and intuitive interfaces powered by our custom AI models.**  Unlike existing generative tools, we give users explicit control over their scene, unlocking professional use-cases. We let designers quickly build out 3D scenes by describing them in plain English– “a jetski in front of a building.“ We then let them transform that scene into a high-quality image with just another description of what they want– “photorealistic yellow jetski, evening sun, 80s magazine ad” Here’s an example of transforming a simple car scene into production-ready concept art: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69920&key=user_uploads/251860/f63e5f85-b22c-451b-aa59-1846384eb605) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69920&key=user_uploads/251860/3e190d62-d65d-48be-9e26-7639ee1ca06c) Or a full landscape from just a couple of boxes: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69920&key=user_uploads/251860/84be4590-2db2-40a6-b61e-5672a55e828e) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69920&key=user_uploads/251860/067a0ef7-f509-4de2-83af-fb30c99254d7) \\ This means you can quickly iterate through multiple concepts and styles, maintaining the same scene composition, without having to spend time & energy building each scene from scratch. It's fast and fluid so you can focus on what you want to create. ### Looking Forward Right now, we let designers create static renders. But soon, we’ll be adding support for animation and video export.  In the longer term, Dream3D will be a complete 3D creative suite– letting you create full games, movies, and simulated worlds. ## Our Story Justin and I are both second-time YC founders. Justin’s last company, Bayes (S19), was a design-focused data analytics tool acquired by Airtable. He has a degree in Computer Science from Columbia. Prior to Dream3D, I led the development of the machine learning platform at Clubhouse and my previous company, Inokyo (S18), built computer vision to automate retail checkout.  I first got interested in computer graphics and storytelling while I was studying at Carnegie Mellon. But, I found my creativity stifled by the complexity of the tools. Now, we’re combining our experiences building prosumer tools and bringing machine learning research to production to make it easy for anyone to create studio-level computer graphics and build the tool I always wish I had. ### The Ask If you do 3D design work (or want to), sign up [here](https://hkqvoariw92.typeform.com/to/QJv3ghPN)!

MagnaPlay — AI-powered game translation,"# **TL;DR** _We use AI-assisted translators to largely automate the process of translating your game. We turn months of work into days, profit-ruining expenses into a manageable cost, and we help connect the world through gaming._ Hey everyone! We’re [Pedro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-esteves-434169204/) and [Paulo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rossirpaulo/) from Brazil, two college dropouts from Harvard and the University of Chicago on the mission to democratize gaming! ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/850536/d16a0f68-1635-4548-822d-2d6ee50300e1) # **❌ The Problem** Well, it’s pretty intuitive that games these days need to be translated, with English speakers compromising only 20% of the gaming population. What isn’t intuitive is how expensive and time consuming this process is.  Traditional localization involves identifying a suitable partner, negotiating complex pricing models, vetting their quality, and paying them tens of thousands for what is often a straightforward task. A part-time developer might have to wait months and invest upwards of $30k to translate their game! # **✨ Our Solution** We built technology that translates entire games in seconds, instead of months. We take into account cultural norms, game context and even screen display sizes. We then cross check texts across languages and pass everything through our QA team, ensuring meaning is preserved and quality is up to the highest standards. \\ We integrate this infrastructure to game devs’ IDEs. Translation is now fully streamlined into the game production process. No back and forth, endless invoices, and contracts ⁠⁠— just one subscription, like any other SAAS tool. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3zdQ0u3UCe3h5et4jEbJJ8rCb-VElM_392zurrbCQp-dg-dPY9GJE6sP57CNzqiXResvekBIsQzccFapNhPsyUpKUd3mftTGLyDFckJDX1eMizPoaTQibIf1me_fn1tQQhNfdBgcNqIiqpPtgll36u0) ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GjSjjOsIeCOTOLVNWClkimrgPsDJOXH6ET4VOw-eGc8gAWhkjz6y1kWUt55FiA8NuuXYaPyEI9CH6RN2lV1GZgqOkZyuIpTN2d807zzDW0FF4csQ5Sd5dyAGYn9MolpWKt6zTpu0yDPzI_XGFY3SL60) Gaming is the entertainment form of the future, and it only makes sense that it should be accessible to everyone around the world.

Texel: Optimizing AI and video pipelines,"**tl;dr: Texel makes your AI infrastructure 10x more efficient. We do this by providing tools and APIs that allow you to quickly encode or decode media and optimize models for inference.**\\ \\ 💸 **The problem:**\\ Many companies run inference on media, to do things like generate images or detect events in scenes. **Running inference is expensive both in compute and cost, and video decoding and encoding is too.** Most developers use the best tools available to optimize inference and media processing in isolation, but shuffling the data between these pipelines is slow. As an example, four different inference pipelines means first decoding a video frame and then sending it to each of four GPUs running different models and finally compositing all the frames before re-encoding. **😎 The solution:** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1188792/4bdc96f4-6c64-44a8-bc65-c07bd88e8437) Vanilla PyTorch running Stable Diffusion (left), Texel-accelerated version (right)\\ \\ We optimize the entire pipeline for you, from input to inference to output, by providing APIs that allow you to control the features you want to activate and taking care of the data flow and scaling behind the scenes. You can bring your own custom models that we optimize, cutting down on inference time and reducing GPU memory size. If you want to just optimize inference, training on media, or encode a video, that’s totally fine and we can do that for you!  In the example mentioned above, the video decode, all four models, and the video encode would be streamlined to run on as few GPUs as possible. **With these optimizations, editing images and videos with AI can become real-time.** **You’ll also save money by using less GPUs.** **📖 The story:** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69917&key=user_uploads/1188792/97257823-69f1-4c89-a8b4-af5bae7b0b92) Rahul (left) and Eli (right) spent years working together building one of the world’s largest GPU-based services at scale while at Snapchat and discovered many optimization techniques. **We built out and ran a fleet of thousands of GPUs serving hundreds of millions of daily active users generating over one billion images per day in real-time.** **Our optimizations saved the company over $20 million a year in operational costs.** AI is taking the world by storm and mainly runs on GPUs, so we saw an opportunity to use our expertise and build the best product in the space. **🔧 How it works:** We deploy your models and provide an API for you to control them and run your inference faster. You can also add rendering, video encoding, or any other GPU-based workflow and it will be accelerated. The deployment can be hosted or on-premise, depending on your needs. **🙏 Our asks:** * Please reach out to us at [founders@texel.ai](mailto:founders@texel.ai) if: * You are running inference and/or processing video/image data and are interested in optimization * You want to try our API out and want to request an API key * Would like to introduce us to others that want to optimize their MLOps and/or VideoOps",Rahul Sheth,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/d80fcd35e61a1a54ba0d1cf93c7abc12013304f7.jpg,Otherimage_28180_1.jpg;Otherimage_28180_2.jpg;,28180

Yuma - ChatGPT for customer support,"**TL;DR:** _Thousands of large Shopify stores all share the same pain: a costly and inefficient customer support. Yuma leverages LLMs and integrates directly with help desks to automate away their high volume of support requests._ ## **The Yuma Story** Hi everyone, I'm G and I'm very pleased to be launching [Yuma](https://yuma.ai), my third company! **I did YC twice before** already, with Socialcam (W12) and Triplebyte (S15). It seems like I just can't help myself, and I had to do it all over again. This time around, however, it's a little bit special as Yuma was launched by accident 🤷‍♂️. I released a prototype in December 2022, and my inbox was inundated with installation requests from Shopify merchants. That's when I knew I was onto something, and I decided to take the plunge. Having experienced that roller coaster ride before, I know exactly what I am signing up for again and I am thrilled about the long and eventful journey that lies ahead. ## **Why do Shopify merchants need Yuma?** There are thousands of Shopify merchants around the world generating $10M+ a year, and they all have one thing in common: **they all hate customer support**. It's a burden for them and a huge source of cost as **they receive hundreds of requests per day**. Some of them have dozens of support agents on staff, usually offshore, and the overall quality is still often pretty poor, while staff turnover remains high. Those merchants have been promised automation for years, but the technology has always fallen short, leaving them disappointed. As customers, we have all had to live through a terrible support automation experience before, so it's no secret that **the available current solutions are pretty bad**. **This has to change**, and we believe that the technology is finally there to fix this problem once and for all. Of course, our goal is for Yuma to do it :) ## **The main things Yuma can do for merchants today:** * **One-click install** into **help desks**: **no configuration required**, zero adoption cost, and no change in workflows for the support agents. * By **combining LLMs with custom knowledge bases**, Yuma suggests drafts to support agents. * By analyzing historical tickets, Yuma can **copy the writing style of any brand**, but also understand and **replicate their current workflows** autonomously. * By bringing the power of LLMs to rules and templates, Yuma delivers a new type of dynamic workflow that wasn't possible before. Yuma is already live on Gorgias at the moment, and our Zendesk app will be live in a few weeks. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69885&key=user_uploads/37163/858ab524-d3ce-461b-968c-43ba41dea793) ## **Our ask 🙏** Do a good deed today and **save a Shopify merchant in your network by telling them about Yuma**.

Not only that, they will receive a white-glove onboarding experience along with a 7-day free trial. :) — — Thank you for reading! 🔥",Guillaume Luccisano,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0c11c755fbf5b493b7b1ddd8ea8d3ddaf32a9210.jpg,Otherimage_28417_1.jpg;,28417
⚡Electric Air - Tesla for heat pumps,"Hi YC! I'm Chris, founder of Electric Air. Electric Air is building the Tesla of home heating and cooling, with a complete solution of modern heat pump technology and direct-to-homeowner purchase and install experience. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69884&key=user_uploads/1004734/c74e4d4a-7304-4605-ac4c-aff2621f3b71) I’ve spent my whole career building and designing thermal systems - first in aerospace, then at Tesla working on Model 3 and Semi Truck, and most recently in vertical farming. I got really excited about residential heat pumps when I realized that we’re about to go through a huge transition where the 80M single family homes in the US replace their furnaces with heat pumps.  **Interested? Check out the Electric Air launch site** [**electricair.io**](https://electricair.io?utm_source=yc&utm_medium=web&utm_id=launch_yc) **and pre-order a system for your home. I’d also love to hear from homeowners about your pain points around heating, cooling and ventilation. You can email me at **[**chris@electricair.io**](mailto:chris@electricair.io)** .** ### **What’s a Heat Pump? 🌎** A heat pump is a really efficient, all electric replacement for your home’s furnace and air conditioner. It uses refrigerant and a compressor to move energy to and from your living spaces. Residential heating makes up 10% of US energy use, and heat pumps are the best option for shifting this segment from fossil fuels. Heat pumps can also save homeowners on their monthly utility bills vs heating with natural gas, propane, fuel oil, and electric resistance. And thanks to the popularity of vapor injection systems, heat pumps now work well even in the cold climates of the Northeast. ### **The Problem** * The homeowner experience sucks because the integration of thermostat, heat pump equipment and air quality systems is terrible. (Nothing works together well, the best thermostats are not fully compatible with efficient heat pumps.) * The process of getting a heat pump is painful, including finding a trustworthy contractor, sorting out financing, and wading through rebates * Contractors struggle with installs because of the difficulty of properly sizing the system, and understanding if your duct work is compatible with a heat pump ### **The Solution 🔥** Electric Air is a full software and hardware solution: * Smart thermostat with PM2.5 and CO2 monitoring that triggers whole-home HEPA filtration and fresh air intake  * Thermostat algorithm uses grid, weather and time-of-use rate plan signals to reduce monthly utility bills * A more powerful air handler and contractor software allows for more ducted installs * A beautiful outdoor condenser means you don’t have to hide this device in an alley * Seamless online sales experience - homeowners can order the system from the Electric Air website and get connected with financing, rebates and a trusted contractor ### **Questions?** Shoot me a message at [chris@electricair.io](https://mailto:chris@electricair.io)",Chris Mui,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/77be6905998da5ee5e4b4c341975a74ed9b85b5f.jpg,Otherimage_27914_1.jpg;,27914
Nebula 🌌 - Understand & debug enterprise-scale codebases,"### TL;DR [**Nebula**](https://www.trynebula.com/) **is a code navigation tool that helps developers quickly understand & debug distributed systems. We make it easy to follow service dependencies & the flow of data across your microservice architecture, saving developers tens of hours per week. Request early access** [**here**](https://mzgq3tvfxmu.typeform.com/to/DD8HB5A5) Hey everyone, we're the founders of Nebula! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69881&key=user_uploads/888634/dd916b21-6237-4b46-ab5b-91a02851586a) **Shanelle** was previously a PM at Google, where she saw firsthand the productivity loss that came with complex microservice architectures. **Vishnu** is a second-time founder who has previously built developer platforms & ML-based document retrieval systems. We've experienced the frustration of seemingly simple features taking months to launch because of the complexity of unwieldy microservice architectures. Building on open-source tooling designed to handle Google-scale codebases, Nebula aims to make it simple and painless to develop microservices. ### Problem 😔 [85% of enterprise companies](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1236823/microservices-usage-per-organization-size/) use a microservice architecture. However, as these codebases scale in size & complexity, developer velocity often slows drastically: 1\\. **trivial changes take weeks to implement** because they impact multiple services or teams across the org 2\\. it takes **longer to debug** issues because it's hard to track the flow of data across your system 3\\. **onboarding** a new developer onto your codebase can take weeks, if not months Companies that switch to microservice architecture often see a dramatic increase in the cognitive overhead required for their engineers to be productive. We've done deep dives with best-in-class companies like Netflix and Linkedin to learn how they dealt with the growing complexity of their codebases. We're combining their most effective strategies with insights from Shanelle's experience at Google to build Nebula. ### How it works [🥳](https://emojipedia.org/partying-face/) Nebula deploys in your cloud & continuously analyzes your codebase to generate an index of inter-service communication, then exposes this info in three ways: 1\\.

Constant — Earn 10%+ yields with top-tier private credit funds,"Hey everyone! Excited to launch [Constant](https://useconstant.com): we let financial advisors and high-net-worth individuals access quality private credit funds. Private credit (like private equity - but for debt) is a $1.4 Trillion asset class that offers high yields, limited risk, and strong diversification from other assets: objectively, it deserves a place in any balanced portfolio. And yet, until now only institutions and ultra-wealthy individuals are invested. We’re changing that. ### **Background** Constant was inspired by my time in the investment industry where I saw firsthand how powerful private credit can be to a portfolio. I previously worked at Silver Point, a credit fund run by the former heads of Goldman Special Situations, Goldman High Yield Credit and Goldman Bank Loans. Prior to Silver Point, I worked at J.P. Morgan, Blackstone and T. Rowe Price. ### **Problem** Few investors have exposure to private credit, even though it would objectively benefit their portfolio. They don’t have the expertise or relationships to invest in the best funds, nor do they have the time to manage the admin work. Plus, most investors can’t meet the $5M minimum investments that private credit funds often require. ### **Solution** Constant’s platform provides a curated set of high-quality private credit funds. Our technology guides users through the complexities of funds, so users can make smart allocation decisions even if they have zero experience. And by pooling investors, we let smaller investors meet the minimum investments of funds – even if they couldn’t meet those minimums on their own. We’re unlocking a compelling asset class: * **Strong risk-adjusted return** – over the last 20 years, private credit returned \\~10% annually compared to \\~6% annually for public loans. Despite capturing higher returns, private credit had lower risk and lower loan losses. * **Hedge against the market** – private credit tends to have a low correlation with other asset classes, providing strong diversification from the rest of your portfolio. * **Hedge against inflation** – interest rates for private credit loans automatically adjust with broader inflation and interest rates, protecting investors from macroeconomic changes. * **Durable return premium** – private credit tends to be less liquid than traditional asset classes, and investors are compensated for this through higher returns. This creates a durable driver for continued outperformance. Institutions and ultra-wealthy investors recognize these benefits - it’s no wonder the private credit industry has grown 350%+ since 2010: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69880&key=user_uploads/690279/db091b09-c4d1-4136-923b-dc730303564b) ### **Asks** * If you’re a high-net-worth individual or a financial advisor, [join our waitlist!](https://useconstant.typeform.com/to/nBs4t4RF) * If you know advisors or individuals who could be a good fit, please share this post or reach out at [connect@useconstant.com](mailto:connect@useconstant.com)",Ben Sender,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/162f32c3544964939c9b2297b2773d2cd39899cf.jpg,Otherimage_28094_1.jpg;,28094
DAGWorks: Avoid Machine Learning Pipeline horror stories 😱,"👋 Hi, Stefan & Elijah here from [DAGWorks](https://dagworks.io). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69876&key=user_uploads/1208898/cf51f7bb-c9a2-495e-91d8-afb1ddfc0192) ### **TL;DR:** (1) At DAGWorks Inc. our goal is to make Machine Learning (ML) initiatives more human capital efficient. (2) Our solution is an open source SaaS platform for Data Science teams to build and maintain model pipelines, plugging into as much of your existing MLOps and data infrastructure as you want. (3) Star our open source project [Hamilton on github](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton) and get started with it via [tryhamilton.dev](https://www.tryhamilton.dev). ### **❌ The Problem:** Ask a Data Scientist whether they like inheriting someone else’s ML pipelines. 99% of the time, they’ll say no. Why? Getting ML to production is easy when you’re small, but when your team and codebase start to grow, maintaining these pipelines becomes challenging: * 😕 understanding code you didn’t write * 🐛 debugging production issues * 🏗️ migrating to new infrastructure * 🥼 handling personnel changes This causes teams to spend far more time keeping existing ML pipelines afloat than innovating and driving their business forward. To get out of/avoid such a mess, you need a high (and expensive) software engineering skill set, but for many that’s not an option. In our experience, this phenomenon is the biggest blocker to leveraging machine learning in your business as it grows. ### **✨ Our Solution** (1) We leverage our open source project [Hamilton](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton), which is an opinionated way to write python code (akin to what DBT did for SQL), that naturally helps teams follow software engineering best practices. (2) Using the DAGWorks Client on top of Hamilton, we can give you full insight into how your pipelines operate on the DAGWorks Platform, including: A **catalog of functions** - feature catalog anyone? ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lDX_3El7R6_OdBZg_tfBekfl--qUUmsmm10wBFcZcE59wrTn01e2_U8Ns-LC73fCfsJ1kmGirfbZ6XT_T_uqniK7SyJsPPZt6BXb8byJCq_C6HNlFhsdOLdiPdyVWAwS18x4D2bAQhN19AVX4Ouga6w) **Lineage** - see upstream and downstream dependencies: ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-EwfBtPJB1OkF3JtS_JATLshDFHTnudGU5qyn9TqZJ3i29LcZGw0pU4Xed3Yb-apaRETO2HqQY_mDCD1ucOt8MQA5VH0D7Q_uCW99uh90c72nbKEeY8dvn5ppH5zhM0i-PtKJHDfxEYwaojPezU1ZlE) **Debugging insights** - e.g. know exactly what code failed given an airflow task failure: ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/j6gqllKW9oDbC9r8KC4_TRusN3MxSemIySmHq8PhSZnwOYGDwQ5ckwe-LIW4MFdtKtRfjpyCXlE_qTpQTT5boMbIDNfMgOz9huOG01UK0RuGQLFxTIR7YMuEAy5OfDuQJc-qDqdaGFLUy_9NR4nl3mo) And more like **data observability**, and **links with materialized artifacts** (like data sources, models, features, etc.). (3) The DAGWorks Platform becomes your ML Pipeline control plane. Use it to manage integrations with your existing infrastructure, as well as providing any reporting and compliance insights you need. ### **⚙️ How it works** With [Hamilton](https://github.com/dagworks-inc/hamilton), users logically express what should happen, which helps avoid vendor and infrastructure lock in. Then with the DAGWorks Platform & Client, we make your Hamilton code run on your existing infrastructure, providing out of the box connectors to common systems, and provide insights post execution. By building on a solid foundation that clearly decouples concerns, we can avoid the problems that plague traditional ML Pipelines. This enables Data Science teams to move faster and do more themselves, making ML projects more human capital efficient. **👪 Founding Team** [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skrawczyk/) and [Elijah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elijahbenizzy/) worked together at Stitch Fix where they built the self-service ML Platform for over 100 data scientists. They learned firsthand the troubles that occur building and maintaining ML Pipelines over a diverse set of modeling disciplines. Their work has been recognized by industry and included in books, newsletters, and was even the topic of a lecture at Stanford. Previously Stefan built data and ML systems at Nextdoor and LinkedIn and graduated from the Stanford CS Masters program with a Distinction in Research. Elijah built tools for quants at Two Sigma and studied Math and CS at Brown. ### **🙏 Asks** 1.

🚛 Vooma - Backoffice automation for logistics,"**_tldr_**_: Vooma fully automates order taking from shippers for brokers and carriers. We help logistics companies scale with less headcount, reduce cost per load and eliminate data entry errors. Reach out at _[_www.vooma.ai_](http://www.vooma.ai)_._ Hello! We’re Mike and Jesse, and we’re building Vooma. ### 🎊 Vooma: a backoffice automation platform for logistics Vooma is a back-office automation platform for freight brokers and carriers that fully automates order taking from shippers. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/887217/2a8f7b68-4b35-46d5-9e22-852e63f32c67) ### 😰 Taking orders from shippers is still extremely manual Today brokers and carriers receive 60% of orders (\\~$200BN of freight) over email text, spreadsheets and PDFs and key them into their systems manually. The industry spends \\~$750M per year in salaries alone on this problem. Only a fraction of shippers have transportation management systems, and a smaller fraction can send orders digitally. There’s no good solution for logistics companies. Some have tried robotic process automation, but the variety of file types makes RPA clunky, slow and not cost effective. For brokers and carriers, building loads manually: * is expensive, * distracts from higher value tasks, * results in billing and operational errors, and * makes scaling without headcount hard. ### 💡 How does Vooma work? It’s simple. 1. Reps forward order emails to Vooma 2. Vooma extracts the load details 3. Vooma pushes the load to the broker/carrier system through EDI / API With Vooma, brokers and carriers can: * Scale with less headcount * Reduce cost per load * Eliminate data errors ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/887217/0121e6db-796e-4a32-a721-c875b45b4c78) We’ve successfully solved the order entry problem where others have failed by combining our computer vision expertise with today’s large language models. ### 🧑‍🤝‍ 🧑 The Vooma team Jesse and Mike were introduced by a close mutual friend and bonded over a love of logistics.  Mike had built self driving trucks as a founding engineer at Kodiak Robotics ($250M raised), establishing and leading their motion planning and safety teams. Prior to that he was an autonomy engineer at Uber ATG and Otto. Jesse had grown a private equity backed logistics software company from $2M to $20M+ ARR as CEO, selling to brokers and truckers. He saw first hand that every logistics company struggled with order entry and no good solution existed. Jesse and Mike teamed up and realized they were perfectly positioned to solve the order entry problem, combining a deep understanding of the businesses that feel this pain with the computer vision, AI, and automation expertise necessary to make it go away. ### 🙌🏼 Our asks Are you a freight broker or carrier and want to experience the magic of automated order entry?  Or have any brokers or carriers in your network?  Email us at [founders@vooma.ai](mailto:founders@vooma.ai) or visit us at [www.vooma.ai](http://www.vooma.ai) to connect.",Jesse Buckingham,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/beda235871c37f5e7e57fc5b27fb5e091ef22efa.jpg,Otherimage_27827_1.jpg;Otherimage_27827_2.jpg;,27827
Milio - B2B payments infrastructure for emerging markets,"**TL;DR:** Milio is building **B2B payments infrastructure for emerging markets, domestic and cross-border**, and connecting it to legacy ERPs through one single API. Milio's platform allows faster money movements, real-time access to data, and treasury automations through efficient workflows and seamless account-to-account domestic and cross-border payments. Real-time and 80% cheaper. ### **The problem** In Latin America, **legacy B2B payments infrastructure** doesn’t allow automated transaction initiation and costs up to 3% through local ACH networks and credit card processing fees. Cross-border payments rails are expensive and inefficient, with up to 5% FX spreads.  In addition, **no single checkout is built for the B2B-commerce**; and legacy **ERPs are siloed from the payments infrastructure**, involving long treasury workflows and over 20h/week in manual work. ### **Milio’s solution 💡** Milio enables real-time **B2B account-to-account payments, both domestic and cross-border**, that are **real-time** and save up to 80% of transactions cost and FX rates. Our API provides an **embedded checkout for B2B-commerce** and connects it to legacy ERPs, enabling automated treasury workflows that save our customers over 10h per week in manual work. Our customers can now access affordable money movements, real-time data, and a **unique B2B checkout experience** that increases conversion rate by 2x.  ### **How does Milio work? ✅** Milio is building an account-to-account payments infrastructure across all of Latin America, both domestic and cross-border, that enables real-time payments (T+0) and the best B2B checkout experience. Our customers can automate how they pay, get paid, and reconcile their ledger, saving up to 80% in transaction costs and over 10h per week in manual work. They can also offer the best checkout experience to their business customers by enabling account-to-account one-click real-time payments at checkout, designed explicitly for B2B transactions, increasing conversion rates by 2x. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69870&key=user_uploads/627782/948bba8a-dbe6-4e7e-ac5e-6e4f51024772) ### **Why are we working on this?** Exchanging money and accessing premium financial services for local enterprises in LatAm is a nightmare. This is experienced every day by business owners across the region, including the co-founders who have spent time working for large payment fintechs and owning SMBs across the region. We firmly believe that helping those local enterprises and entrepreneurs ­means helping any economy to thrive and grow to its maximum potential. We are committed to solving this problem.  **💥** **Milio was the first Milio client! 💥** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69870&key=user_uploads/627782/5c6ed840-bc0b-4fa3-a0fe-b7986a0056fd) ### **Our ask 🙏🏻** * **Please contact us at**: [founders@miliopay.com](mailto:founders@miliopay.com)",Toni Riera,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/6f11ce07954de9ae8f474a64ba744b45d746e85a.jpg,Otherimage_28007_1.jpg;Otherimage_28007_2.jpg;,28007
"Storyboarder - Create, buy, and sell webcomics","# TLDR: Storyboarder is a tool and platform that enables anyone to create, buy, and sell webcomics. Over 650,000 users have used Storyboarder to make movies like Black Panther, Cruella, I Tonya, and Modern Family — and now we're expanding to webcomics. Hi Everyone! We’re [Charles Forman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iminlikewithyou/) and [Joe Watkins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-watkins-06925295/), the founders of [Storyboarder](https://storyboarder.com/). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69867&key=user_uploads/73262/1d6bac9f-7694-4132-b0e9-b6f55630014f) If you have an idea for a story, you can use Storyboarder to tell it by adding characters to a scene and typing in dialogue - the tool will automatically generate the shots you need to tell your story. You can post episodes of your story to the platform as part of a series, and other people can buy the episodes to read them. ## 🤬 **Currently, it’s too hard to make webcomics - You have to be able to draw!** In East Asia, the webcomic (or digital manga) industry is a $12B market - and it’s rapidly growing to the rest of the world. People are addicted to reading webcomics. For example, the largest company in the space, Webtoon, has 100M MAU and generates $1.2B in annual revenue. The problem is that the variety and appeal of webcomics is constrained by the number of webcomic artists - you need to know how to draw to make a webcomic. ## 💜 **We make it easy for anyone to make webcomics!** Storyboarder is a 3D scene editor. You pick a scene. You add characters. You type in what they say. Storyboarder makes the panels for you, and then you can edit them as much as you want. We have a world class rendering system, so everything ends up looking absolutely beautiful! Storyboarder is also a platform for posting your comics as episodes in series. After your readers read 5 of your episodes, they can pay the equivalent of 20 cents to read additional episodes. ## 🧔🧔‍♂️ **Why are we building this?** I, (Charles), was working on making a movie. I wanted the story to be good, but I had no experience. Pixar uses storyboarding as a tool to iterate on their stories. They can see each version of their movie and rapidly iterate on it. Being the creative / engineer that I am, I made a storyboarding tool so I could create storyboards without having to draw. I released the tool, Storyboarder, and 700K people use it to storyboard movies and tv shows like Black Panther, Cruella, I, Tonya, and Modern Family. We were ready to start shooting my movie in March of 2020 - then the pandemic hit. We realized we wouldn’t be able to make the movie. So I focused on Storyboarder. Working with some of the best writers, directors, and storyboard artists in the world, I saw a bunch of fantastic storyboards for movies that would never be filmed. They were cancelled because of covid. I realized that there are tons of stories that never see the light of day because they can’t get made into movies. Being depressed about COVID, I spent time on Clubhouse, where I met my cofounder Joe. We talked a lot about the world of online fiction and webcomics and how it relates to storyboarding. We learned that Webtoon is huge and makes tons of money, but very few of their stories appeal to us, or many people I know. Webtoon creators are a particular type of person that need to know how to draw. I used to make videogames. I started OMGPOP (YC06). We built 35 games and a game called “Draw Something” We sold the company for $200M. Joe was running a team of ML engineers at Google and worked on computer vision at Waymo. So we thought we could combine forces to build the next generation of storytelling with online 3D tech, game tech, and AI. Joe and I thought, what if we make a tool where anyone can make webcomics without having to draw? The stories created would appeal to so many more people. We did the math: 3 out of 10 Americans buy e-books: 100M people X $12 (ARPPU on Webtoon). That’s $1.2B. 10X Globally: $12B! ## **Checks all the boxes:** ✅ **Making stories is important and fun!** \\ ✅ **Huge Market: $12B.** \\ ✅ **Built in 650K Users.** \\ ✅ **Previous YC06 videogame company with success: $200M Exit.** **\\#29 Top YC Exit.**\\ ✅ **Investors include**: David Karp (**Tumblr Founder**), Andrew Kortina (**Venmo Founder**), **Jonathan Glick** (NYT), **Andy Artz** (Best man in the world), other top secret celebs and good looking rich people. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69867&key=user_uploads/73262/c4ddcafc-e38e-49f9-8259-b90af30cfb5c) _Various gingers: Laura (Joe’s partner), Joe, some freakishly tall guy, and Charles._ ### **The Ask:** 🚀 Do you want in on this rocket ship?

🚀 Peeba - Faire for Asia,"**tl;dr:** Peeba is a B2B wholesale marketplace that simplifies the buying process for retailers in Asia, connecting them with over 2,500 brands from around the world at the best prices, with free returns and 60 days payment terms. 👋 Hello everyone! We are Kevin and Jacky, founders of [Peeba](https://www.peeba.com/). ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Z8jALKdiHQaXA8YwXCDv9tYOySii1nPFLOWqAkbsav0X8egaQ3d0veCkDIZeYFsl5pvm3G7dUBT1QaQvL6XTOIX29d0_zlx60rkmtdoygpWQrs41aV1vONYLLRjx1yjecZoGL1qyhA5ANhCvG6e0Eac) **Problems:** Despite the growth in e-commerce over the last decade, the B2B wholesale industry in Asia that supports and connects retailers with brands languishes in the pre-digital era and lags behind in technology adoption - over 80% of wholesale transactions in Asia are still brokered over phone and physical meetings with sales representatives. Retailers face difficulty discovering relevant new products, it is risky to take on new products and very cumbersome to manage multiple brand/supplier relationships. The same applies for brands - going to trade-shows to entice buyers is expensive and inefficient. This problem is amplified in Asia where people are spread out across different countries, with different languages, different payment methods, different logistics infrastructure and non-transparent pricing creates many layers of challenges for retailers and brands to build relationships.  **Solution:** Peeba addresses these pain points by providing a one-stop B2B wholesale marketplace that offers retailers in Asia access to thousands of best selling products with flexible buy-now-pay-later options and free returns. Our platform uses machine learning to enable discovery, allowing retailers to streamline their procurement process, automating many of the tedious tasks associated with buying inventory and simplifying cross-border logistics, making it easy for retailers to discover new brands and manage inventory. With our free return policy, retailers can reduce inventory risk and purchase with confidence, helping them to buy inventory that their customers will love.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69864&key=user_uploads/1119720/a04b3631-f594-4707-974c-4e2b9a0f72be) **A bit more about us:** We kicked off our journey in mid-2020 and since then, we've been on a mission to make B2B trade simpler, connecting retailers across 13 markets in Asia with over 2,500 brands and growing! The more we dive into the complexities of the industry, the more driven we become to simplify wholesale for everyone involved. Our goal is to empower retailers across Asia to achieve more by revolutionizing the way B2B wholesale trade is done, bringing efficiency and simplicity to the forefront of the industry. **Ask:** If you are a brand looking to expand your wholesale business in Asia, please reach out to us [here](https://peeba.com/brands).

Momentum Foods,"### **TL;DR** _At_ [_Momentum Foods_](https://www.linkedin.com/company/momentumfoods/)_, we’re adding meat back into plant-based meat to make it more affordable, healthy, and delicious._  ### **Overview** After five years developing and scaling textured protein (the base of every product) at Beyond Meat, I realized two things: 1. Plant-based meat companies don’t have a clear path to improving product quality _and_ decreasing cost. 2. The 96% of the population that regularly eats meat cares more about cost, health, and flavor than whether their food is vegan.

🏠 Trigo 🏠 Rent data API for landlords and lenders,"Hi! We’re [Sam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samsonstein/) & [Abe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abrahamwheeler/), founders of [Trigo](https://trigodata.com/). **TLDR:** **Trigo** aggregates **consumer rent history** to help **landlords approve better tenants** and **lenders write more loans**. We have **25x more coverage** than the credit bureaus, and we’ve already consolidated **tens of thousands of rental units** to provide data instantly. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1092278/edd9cd08-b7d8-48f6-8830-8a7d9f3d4731) ## ❓ Rent Data is Missing 🏠 **Landlords**: **Bad debt & evictions are at all time highs** in the U.S., and landlords need more data for added protection across the **60+ million tenants screened annually**. Applicants with positive rent history are **4x more likely** to pay their rent on-time and in full. 🏦 **Lenders**: In 2021, financial institutions including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac added rent payment data to their underwriting models to expand access to credit. Without rent data to input into these models, **lenders are writing 17% fewer loans than they could**. That’s a lot of missed loans across the **300 million consumer loan originations** annually in the U.S.! ❌ **No solution exists** to consistently furnish this data to landlords and lenders today. The largest database has only **3% coverage** of rent data. ## 🔌 Trigo Rent API **Trigo** is a federally regulated **Consumer Reporting Agency (CRA)** that provides this missing rent data set through a **real-time API** and web application. We’ve already consolidated **tens of thousands of rental units** to provide **instant data**. Where we don’t yet have data coverage, we **automate outreach** to landlords. ## 👋 About Us We’re repeat founders with consumer data and finance experience across Experian, Citigroup, and Amazon. Trigo began when Sam pulled his own credit report and realized not one of his landlords over the past decade had reported a single month’s rent payment to the credit bureaus. With a little research, we discovered that **this data has only 3% coverage in the market today**. Sam met Abe through [YC cofounder matching](https://www.ycombinator.com/cofounder-matching) (amazing product - 🤝 YC!), and the rest is history. ## 🙏 Our Ask Thanks for reading about us.

Sign up via [this form](https://forms.gle/PXehPe3XZaymkFEdA) and check us out at [our website](https://parlan.io), and we’ll give you early product access. Hi everyone, **Leeho** and **Jonathan** here, the team behind Parlan. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69845&key=user_uploads/399378/aed13737-5731-441d-a726-9d256c504882) ## [**❌**](https://emojiguide.com/symbols/cross-mark/#:\\~:text=cross%20mark%20%E2%9D%8C,question%2C%20is%20incorrect%20or%20wrong.) **The problem** Today, business teams are blocked from analyzing their data, because they might not know SQL, or because SQL isn’t convenient enough to work with. Users who don’t know SQL might ask business intelligence, data science, or engineering teams to help them pull their data from a database. For users that do know SQL, they still prefer not to write bulky-lined queries for the simplest of analyses. ## [**🤷**](https://emojipedia.org/person-shrugging/) **How did we get here?** In our previous orgs, Jonathan and I saw our colleagues struggle to get the data that they needed in order to perform any analysis. We found ourselves helping them pull data, and we also really hated the experience of having to use SQL any time that we had to do our own analysis [🤮](https://emojipedia.org/face-vomiting/). ## [**🛠️**](https://emojipedia.org/hammer-and-wrench/) **Our solution** So we created Parlan. Parlan allows you to embed any database or data warehouse into a spreadsheet through a no-code connection pane. We lift the row limitations of traditional spreadsheets, and equip users with the power of SQL through the formulas that you already know and love. With our spreadsheet, you can first connect your data sources (even ones that contain millions of rows) into our spreadsheet. You can then use our spreadsheet to run any analysis that you’d like on your data with syntax that you’re already familiar with. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69845&key=user_uploads/399378/af9213d4-7bfc-4c0d-b8d0-3e51b1e30d7d) Using our sheet connection pane, you can select your data source(s), check a few boxes, and you’re good to go!

🌔 Intrinsic - Safety tooling for Trust & Safety teams,"**tl;dr:** We make it easy to take care of safety so that you can focus on the product. Intrinsic integrates **policy management, data engineering, moderator workflow management, and content understanding** under one platform. [Ping us for a demo!](https://www.withintrinsic.com/contact) \\ Hey everyone! We’re Karine and Michael, the team behind Intrinsic. We’re working to help connect safety teams with the best tools available to prevent abusive behaviour and tell better stories. We both come from Apple and Discord, where we worked on the Trust & Safety machine learning and data engineering infrastructure that was pivotal in protecting both platforms from large-scale abuse. We believe that a safer internet for everyone starts with more accessible safety tools. ### **Who this is for** * Engineers implementing safety features into products * Product managers and directors of Trust & Safety teams ### **Problem** Trust & Safety engineers are tasked with maintaining platform integrity and user safety in an era of evolving **fake accounts, illegal content, hate speech, misinformation, and child safety concerns.** Nobody wants this stuff on their platforms, but getting up and running with industry best practices is challenging. Currently, there are two huge barriers to shipping safety-by-default products: * T&S teams are siloed from crucial data they need to evaluate safety risks and measure impact. Product and customer service teams own this data. * Data integration with either in-house or third-party detection services is costly. As a result, safety engineers and data scientists are caught in an endless cycle of blindsided firefighting and doing tedious integrations. ## **Solution** Intrinsic is a platform for Trust & Safety with a focus on scalability and composability of processes to help a company move faster in responding to evolving threats: * We handle setting up detection, enforcement, policy management, and integrating an observability platform designed for Trust and Safety. * We focus on helping you get up and running end-to-end in minutes for a new safety product integration. * We automatically make all Trust & Safety actions, whether banning users or flagging content for review, to be logged and measurable. * We can help diagnose failures by tracing safety stories that span disparate products, for example tracing a particular enforcement back to a specific clause of terms and conditions that was breached. Trust & Safety and Fraud are two problem domains that require rapidly evolving AI systems that start with machine learning and rules (proactive detection) and end with human decisioning (content moderation). We believe that by streamlining this process and closing the feedback loop — **the applications go far beyond Trust & Safety and into any domain that benefits from a rapidly evolving response**. ## **Asks** If you know anyone who’s ever had issues with the following, * Spam, fake accounts, bots * Low-quality content * High-harm content (bullying, child safety issues, violent speech) Ping [Karine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karinemellata/), [Michael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-lin-2933a013b/) or [founders@withintrinsic.com](mailto:founders@withintrinsic.com), we would love to schedule a demo!",Karine Mellata,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/7b6c8e84fc0d16df4298ba7d7a737691dfe019dd.jpg,,27926

Here’s how – 1. **👀 Observe:** We connect with the customer’s sales and inventory data sources (Amazon and Shopify to start, more to come soon), and create a real-time view of customer elasticities and conversion rates.  2. **👉 Recommend**: We feed historical sales, competitor and market data into our machine learning model, combine it with inventory availability and make recommendations for price and discount adjustments. 3. **🖐 Act:** We bubble up the recommendations over email and Slack, allowing the business to quickly act upon the data and push the changes to production across all their channels. 4. **⚙ Configure**: Lastly, we allow the business to configure custom rules, such as competitor-based pricing guardrails or wholesale-price-based constraints. **Asks** * If you work in retail and would like to try our product, please sign up [here](https://forms.reform.app/pqNBb1/early-access-1/kZx3w2) and we will get in touch with you. * If you know someone in your network who would be interested in this, please drop us a note at [founders@askluca.com](mailto:founders@askluca.com)",Tanvi Surti,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/e99d450c6f9d89602f3c79e4dc1b0ef0709c2a85.jpg,Otherimage_28129_1.jpg;Otherimage_28129_2.jpg;,28129
(🌍) Bluedot - Single payment solution for electric vehicle drivers and fleets,"### **TL;DR** * **What:** [Bluedot](https://thebluedot.co/) is a single payment platform for EV (electric vehicle) drivers and fleets to charge their cars and manage expenses. * **Traction:** We continue to grow since launching publicly on December 15. As of Feb. 28, our **GMV was $82K last wee**k, and it’s **growing by 45% weekly**. We have closed 5 fleet companies. * **Here’s what one of our EV fleet management customers had to say:** “We have partnered up with Bluedot to give our drivers a better charging experience and understand charging behavior and optimize it. Our drivers enjoy using Bluedot so far. The charging map is great and makes it easy for me to drive without worrying.”  “They love that they can pay a flat fee at any charging station and pay without having to download numerous apps. Saves money and time!” ### ⏳ **Problem and how fuel card industry is changing** Currently, EVs account for 5% of new car sales in the US and the Biden administration has set an ambitious goal to increase the **market share to 50% by 2030.** To encourage EV adoption, the federal government is investing in building 500,000 new public charging stations for these cars. Along the way, the projected spend for all-electric vehicle charging is expected to hit **$25 billion**. However, this transformation comes with some challenges and opportunities around charging and payments, such as: 📱 **Accessibility:** Currently, to charge their cars, drivers need 5-6 different apps & cards to find and pay at charging stations. This is especially inefficient and difficult for fleet drivers who need to charge frequently. 📊 **Trackability:** It’s hard for fleet managers and drivers to track charging behavior and spending, which creates an inefficient ecosystem. 🧾 **Reimbursement:** Lack of accessibility and trackability also makes it harder for fleet drivers to get reimbursed for charging expenses. Also, most drivers can charge their cars at home, which adds to reimbursement problems. ### Bluedot aims to address these challenges and help accelerate the transition to EV transportation. ### **💡 How Does Bluedot Work?** ▶️ **Bluedot Driver App:** EV drivers can access 60% of available charging stations and pay with the [Bluedot App](https://bluedot.app.link/SPpSLBVv8ub), while also enjoying savings on auto-related expenses. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69841&key=user_uploads/711269/024d8b2f-e99b-44bf-9b06-b368614ec80f) ▶️ **Bluedot Dashboard:** Fleet managers can monitor and authenticate driver permissions, as well as gain better visibility into charging and driving behavior, helping to improve fleet efficiency and control costs. ### **👥 Bluedot Crew** > ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/825Nr_5QT2HD7fYmh4DKuM9NiifgbBP7hNua8V_VxG2pwDcRE7KFieNd_FHkLSy_wCZLjcEAhg8sVfo_SDcwa3dJ3MwKVlPVlcq7rGrYtp5BgtKyz0HuHvdXiH-fKyHsgLDc4rzhQqwgZTOa2kBKUkQ) _From our Bluedot Exclusive event for our drivers_ Our team comprises long-time friends Ferhat and Selinay, who have known each other since high school.

Propify: Plaid for Real Estate 🏢,"# 📚 TL;DR **The professionally managed real estate market is massive**. Unfortunately, it is difficult to sell products or services to this market because the systems of record are legacy software vendors with bad APIs. Propify's API allows companies to integrate with these systems in weeks, not years. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/997737/fbfa8b9c-aac6-449d-af99-d9696611c11e) Hey everyone! We're Remen, Nick, and Ben from [Propify](http://www.getpropify.com). We entered the proptech world in 2020 and quickly realized the single biggest problem was accessing the data from the major systems of record. # ⚠️ **The Problem: Fragmentation and Legacy Software**  The managed real estate market includes 290k companies, 80M tenants, and $300B in rent payments. This market is not only for \""proptechs.\"" Amazon, Lowes, and Progressive Insurance actively sell into the space.  The most significant headwind to innovation has been the effort to integrate with the systems of record: Property management software.  It is a fragmented market where SOAP APIs are the norm and documentation is rarely available. In addition, companies like Zuma (S21) have entire teams managing these integrations - they often take years to build the complete list.    # 👨‍🔬 **The Solution: A unified API** Propify's API and unified data model allow a company to integrate with the six most prominent players in weeks. Additionally, we provide modern developer tooling like Webhooks, which is largely missing from the native integrations. # 👨‍🔬 **How it works:** With Propify, you integrate once to access all of our supported integrations.

⚡️ Baselit: AI copilot for analytics,"**TL;DR** Baselit is AI copilot for analytics. Product and business teams use Baselit to query and analyze data using plain English. For example, a PM can chat with his database to figure out the answer to “Why did our GMV drop last month?” without relying on data teams. Take a look at how [Baselit](https://baselit.ai/) copilots the role of a data analyst in this short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHp4TIr4WGY)! ### **The Problem** **Databases are black boxes for those who actually need data** Databases can easily become complex and intractable in a growing company, with teams losing context about how and where the data is stored. The single largest hurdle for product and business teams, while making data-driven decisions, is getting the right data out from the database maze. **Data teams = Long turnaround times + Back and forth** Teams that depend on analysts to fetch data for them end up dealing with long turnaround times and a lot of back and forth. If you don’t have instant access to data, experimentation becomes difficult, which means insights get lost. ### **Our Solution** Baselit enables users to run the data query-transform-visualize workflow using simple English instructions. The underlying model is GPT-3 enriched by training on contextual information like database schema, metrics catalog etc. at the time of setup. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/996541/a28caab6-54c8-4bfb-87da-a613b79ecafc) **How does it work?** 1. **Connect** Baselit to your data sources (Postgres, Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery). 2. **Chat** with your database and get answers using plain English. Baselit auto-generates the relevant SQL. 3. **Export** results to your favorite visualization tool (integrates with Tableau, Metabase, Excel, Google Sheets, Power BI, Superset). ### **Can I try it?** We have a live [playground](https://play.baselit.ai/) that anyone can try - contact us to get access! \\ If you are interested in simplifying databases for your product/business teams, we’d love to talk!

Based on customer feedback, we pivoted, and landed our first 5 paying customers based on Figma mockups. ### **🏗 How it’s going** During YC, we’ve built… 1. **Time Tracking** — which has replaced paper time cards or generic time tracking apps for our customers 2. **Payroll** — which has replaced generic payroll providers (QuickBooks, ADP, and Gusto) 3. **Job Costing** — which has replaced our customers’ workflow of manually plugging project and hours data into spreadsheets ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69825&key=user_uploads/379301/c72f491f-f084-484f-9ae7-1fa5eda1eb08) ### ### **🤬 Problem** Contractors are not experts in running a business. They’re masters of their craft. They enjoy spending most of their time in the field with their crew and bidding on new projects. But today they spend 10+ hours every week in busy work just to keep the business running. The root cause is tradition back office software is designed for a broad range of industries and contractors are tired of using point solutions with a mix of paper and spreadsheets to manage their workforce. These point solutions include… 👨🏻‍🏫 Payroll systems such as ADP or Quickbooks designed for a broad range of industries 💬 Text messages for scheduling and reporting 📊 Spreadsheets for job costing ⏳ Generic time tracking apps ### ### **🔨 Solution** Hammr is an all-in-one platform purpose-built for construction. We deeply understand the perspectives of field workers who build, foremen who manage the field, and business owners and admin staff who run the back-office. We’ve combined the simplicity of consumer products into the flexibility and robustness of business software, and created a solution that’s native to how construction companies operate. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69825&key=user_uploads/379301/812fbc44-844d-4319-accf-525b2e179af8) \\ Our platform seamlessly combines… 🕦 **Time Tracking**: Accurately track time and attendance for the entire workforce with compliant overtime calculations 💰 **Payroll**: Calculate payroll automatically for both W2s and 1099 workers and ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations 📈 **Job Costing**: Real-time fully-burdened labor cost per job helps owners make decisions to drive productivity and profitability 👥 **HR Management**: Manage employee records, benefits, and compliance all in one place \\ We’re on a mission to help contractors spend less time on admin work, so they can focus on growing their business and investing into their biggest asset — their people. ### **🙏🏼 Our Asks** 📣 **Sharing**: Please share this announcement with your network and follow us on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hammr/)!\\ 👥 **Referrals**: If you know anyone in the construction industry who could benefit from Hammr, please connect us.",Sanket Firodiya,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/046cf2dfe0f7a340bc0759053d9df4a072ffe1c2.jpg,Otherimage_27710_1.jpg;Otherimage_27710_2.jpg;Otherimage_27710_3.jpg;,27710
🔐 Inquery: The safe way to make database changes,"### TL;DR [Inquery](https://inquery.io) is an open-source platform that helps engineers safely make database changes. Instead of letting developers directly modify data in production, with Inquery teams can preview, approve, and run SQL updates with confidence. Hi everyone, we’re Eric and Mitch from [Inquery](http://inquery.io)! 👋 ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69823&key=user_uploads/405594/0a172a87-39de-42f2-915f-b7368d5b9547) ### ❌ Problem Every engineering team has to make changes to their data, and every engineer has an example of when a bad query brought down a production service. To prevent this companies restrict database access, slowing down development and costing millions in lost productivity. The smartest, biggest companies have built their own internal tools for managing access and monitoring database updates. Everyone else is stuck with a patchwork of manual collaboration tools to coordinate changes. ### ✅ Solution Inquery is a platform that enables engineers to safely make database changes. Engineers propose their SQL query with a GitHub-like review experience, displaying a change preview and visual query plan. Teammates are able to view this information and approve the change for execution. Everyone has access to the change history for audit purposes. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/405594/af596d97-9c9b-4e02-bb1f-883a9d3ea7a6) **How it works:** We generate a change preview to show exactly which data will be modified, including the number of tables and rows that will be affected. We also provide a visual query plan that provides estimations for execution time. Before the change can be run, approval is required by a team member. Depending on the size of team, this approval might be required by a specific seniority level or a certain group of users that own that specific data set. ### 👥 Team We met when we were both working at Heymarket, a Series-A startup in SF. Mitch was the first product hire, and Eric was the first full-stack engineer. During our two years there we co-owned many projects and defined many of the engineering & product processes to help the company scale. We became friends outside of the office through tennis, pickleball, mountain biking, and skiing. [Mitch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchpatin/) started his career as an engineer before moving to the dark side (product manager 😛). He previously worked at GE Digital, Bolt, and founded a company focused on B2B payments. [Eric](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericciminelli/) is a software engineer that previously worked at Facebook, myMatrixx, and co-founded a company that provided a search engine for car shopping online.",Mitch Patin,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/1951bf8df013b0f7a0a692a6e5c288aa4392e57c.jpg,Otherimage_27897_1.jpg;Otherimage_27897_2.jpg;,27897
🪄 Mirio - Spin up personalized demos for your API product in minutes,"**tl;dr: Mirio enables sales teams at API companies to spin up and personalize demo apps in minutes. Stop demoing docs and show every customer a personalized use case.**\\ [**👉 Book a demo**](https://trymirio.com) Hi everyone, we’re [David Correa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/correa-david/) and [Eric Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erictli/), the founders of Mirio. Mirio is a demo platform for sales teams at API companies. Instead of bugging engineers to build custom demos or screen-sharing documentation, sales teams can use our no code-platform to clone, deploy, and personalize demo apps in minutes. ### **For sales teams selling API products** We spoke to account executives and SDRs at API companies and heard the same problems: * Developers are okay with documentation but decision-makers want to visualize the impact on their business and product. * Sales tries to convince engineers and designers to create custom demos but are usually told no (When David and I were asked to help create demos, we hated it too) * As a result, they only personalize demos for top prospects and end up demoing the same documentation and code for most customers, which often doesn’t land. ### **Create personalized demos in minutes with Mirio** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69820&key=user_uploads/322456/74b71732-cae7-4f78-a69e-c02341ab8cb3) Mirio empowers sales teams to spin-up and personalize real apps (connected to your API) so they can convey the magic of your product to every customer. 1. Connect your demo apps to Mirio, we’ll help you set them up so they can be customized. 2. From your Mirio dashboard, account executives and SDRs can clone and deploy demo apps in one click. They can then personalize branding, content, and more using our no-code editor. 3. Use your personalized demos in live meetings, SDR outreach, website embeds, leave-behinds, and more. Track demo engagement from your dashboard. 4. Wow more customers and close more deals! **🚀** ### **Why us?** David and Eric met at as early employees of Bread Financial (NYSE: BFH) where the sales team bugged us every week to help create custom demos for Bread’s developer-facing product. This was time-consuming and painful but we saw the impact that personalized, interactive demos had on closing deals. Outside of Bread, we’ve also built software, designed products, and led teams at companies like Google, Microsoft, Uber, and Vareto. ### **We’d love to chat** * If you’re selling an API product and want to personalize demos with the least amount of effort, book a demo at [trymirio.com](http://trymirio.com) or email us at [founders@trymirio.com](mailto:founders@trymirio.com). * If you’re not, we’d love intros to anyone who is.

Rubbrband: Train open-source ML models in a line of code,"### **What is Rubbrband?** Rubbrband is a CLI tool that enables developers to rapidly experiment with and train the latest open-source ML models. For example, Rubbrband allows you to fine-tune your own version of Dreambooth’s Stable Diffusion in just 1 line of code: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/270510/85f6ebcc-2d0f-49ce-adb9-e2dbb7c23253) ### **Who are we?** We’re college roommates who met at orientation at UC Berkeley. Together we grappled with open-source ML projects that were very difficult to set up (due to CUDA and python dependency conflicts), and even more difficult to apply on our specific research problem. While the state-of-the-art looked magical, it always seemed to be out of reach. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/270510/8cdbfa6d-330c-459f-8d00-c6983ab47480) **Jeremy** (Left) - Former ML researcher at CNMAT at UC Berkeley. **Darren** (Middle) - Former ML researcher at UC Berkeley focused on MRI. **Abhinav** (Right) - Former RL/ML researcher at Berkeley AI Research Lab. ### **The problem** There’s a deluge of breakthroughs in Machine Learning every week. However, it’s extremely challenging for developers to leverage these open-source works to solve their own problems. _This is primarily due to the fact that researchers and ML developers optimize for development velocity, and not for reproducibility or extendibility._ As a result, the entire Machine Learning space seems to be held together with duct tape, as people throw together undocumented scripts to start training runs, which always seem to break one week later. ### **The solution** With Rubbrband, **we want to bring a world-class experience to training ML models**. By creating a simple Python library that abstracts away training environments (CUDA drivers, pip dependencies, and C libraries), and exposing a few commands of interest, _developers will be able to rapidly experiment with the bleeding edge in Machine Learning_. By doing so, developers will be able to solve hard problems that otherwise may have remained unsolved. ### Our ask [Check out our open-source project, and give it a star! ⭐️](https://github.com/rubbrband/rubbrband)",Jeremy Lee,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/87e54f926faa7afd1aa9fb700d1008d824b8fcd5.jpg,Otherimage_27583_1.jpg;Otherimage_27583_2.jpg;,27583
🔘 Nara: The personalized nutritionist in your pocket,"### **TL;DR** Nara helps people eat healthier and stay on track with their dietary goals by providing personalized nutrition recommendations, recipe suggestions, food tracking, and healthier food options for grocery and restaurant ordering using AI. ### **❔ Why we built Nara:** At Nara, we started with a problem that we had experienced firsthand - the challenge of maintaining a healthy diet with a busy schedule. As founders who were passionate about wellness and health, we knew that many people shared this struggle. We saw an opportunity to use AI to make personalized nutrition recommendations and help people stay on track with their dietary goals. Through our previous ventures, we acquired experience in both the wellness and health industry, as well as selling food at a massive scale in companies like Rappi. We knew we had the right team to tackle this problem and build a solution that could truly make a difference in people's lives. We searched the market for a solution that could provide personalized nutrition recommendations and food tracking, but couldn't find one that met our needs. So, we started building our own version of an AI nutrition assistant. After months of trial and error, we created a simple and effective solution that we were proud of. We knew we had to share this with others, and that's why we started Nara. Our goal is to help people eat healthier and stay on track with their dietary goals, all with the help of AI. ### **❌ The Problem:** Eating healthily and deliciously can be a challenge, and it's something that we, as the co-founders of Nara, have experienced firsthand while trying to maintain healthy eating habits with our busy schedules. ### **✨ Our Solution:** Nara solves this problem by allowing users to upload their meal plan into SMS, where Nara learns from it and texts a plan for eating according to the user's preferences and dietary goals. Nara is easy to use and provides a personalized experience that's tailored to the individual. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69791&key=user_uploads/363364/b6b255dd-1287-4394-add7-a6be5a65dd43) ### **⚙️ How it works:** Users can chat with Nara in their messages, just like they would talk to a coach. Nara provides new recipe ideas, food tracking, and answers to questions about the user's meal plan.

Plutis - Semantic search as a service,"Hi 👋 We are Asim and Kamil, co-founders of Plutis. We are bringing the power of semantic search to companies so their customers can find what they’re looking for using conversational language, without having to navigate dozens of filters or browse numerous pages. ### **Problem** When you visit a site like TripAdvisor or LoopNet you’re confronted with a search box that serves as the gateway for interacting with the content and data stored on the platform. This search is very outdated, requiring end users to navigate various filters and browse multiple pages before they get access to the content they are looking for. Because search capabilities are currently limited and do not offer natural language understanding, a few different problems arise for companies: 1. Customers don’t always find what they are looking for, even if it exists on the site, leading to lower conversions. 2. Consumers have increasingly lower attention spans and attrition to competitors can be quite high if search doesn’t work well. 3. Ad placement in search results are less organic and present a tradeoff that can often lead to sub-par customer experiences. ### **Introducing Plutis** We are modernizing the search stack for companies by leveraging LLMs to develop conversational, semantic search which can be used to develop more immersive search experiences that help users find what they are looking for in a fraction of the time.\\ \\ On travel sites leveraging our software, for example, customers can search for 3-day itineraries, romantic restaurants with particular scenery and aesthetics, and even do an end to end experience booking without having to go through the hassle of trying different filters and performing 1-dimensional search queries. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69773&key=user_uploads/171080/0d0a41eb-4d43-4d2d-a26f-053e767ba43c) **_But why would companies not build this on their own or use out of the box models for semantic search?_** Current LLMs (out of the box) can be pretty **costly per search** and are **not purpose-built** for a specific company’s needs. They also suffer from hallucinations (can provide wrong answers that seem correct, leading to a bad consumer experience), provide often **suboptimal results** that don’t understand customer-specific intent, lead to a slowdown in the search experience causing customer attrition, and can provide responses that take the user to another site or competitor. We build lightweight, fine-tuned models to offer a more cost-effective and fast semantic search experience, built on top of a company’s data sources. We expose these fast, dedicated inference endpoints via an API and manage scaling the underlying infrastructure, providing a reliable and powerful search interface that adapts with a company’s needs.  Our APIs not only abstracts out the complexities of standing up a tailored LLM but also provide wrappers that make LLMs work for semantic search (e.g. linking content from data sources that support responses given by the LLMs for a more immersive search and discovery experience, embedding organic advertisements into the conversational interface for more revenue generation opportunities, etc). Companies can freely design the search experience for their applications around these APIs and SDKs. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69773&key=user_uploads/171080/664a8610-af91-45a6-aa1b-070123ae7081) ### **Backstory** We are a team of Stanford and Georgia Tech engineers with research backgrounds in NLP and Deep Learning. Kamil used to work at AWS on their knowledge system and AWS support stack, where he stood up Elasticsearch infrastructure and helped develop NLP systems to improve the self-serve customer support experience on the AWS console. Through that experience, he realized the challenges of semantic search and how LLMs could help improve user experiences in a much-needed way. Asim has also worked on standing up ML infrastructure and deploying RNNs for tasks like noise suppression in video conferencing while working on AccessBell (acq. by Tata).

Pair AI - Monetize your knowledge in a scalable way,"### **TL;DR:** [**Pair**](https://www.pairai.com/) **is the first truly mobile education platform.** We make learning as fun and engaging as watching a TikTok by enabling any creator to launch premium white-label mobile courses. As successful 7-figure course entrepreneurs ourselves, we have reimagined the course platform experience for the next generation of creators with best-in-class gamification tools and proprietary AI to maximize each student's learning.  **⭐️ The Team:** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69766&key=user_uploads/1052399/03a2e5b1-eace-4b12-beff-4c2c8c8fb1d4) [**Parth Detroja**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parthdetroja/) **(CEO)** is the global bestselling author of [Swipe to Unlock](https://www.amazon.com/Swipe-Unlock-Technology-Business-Strategy/dp/1976182190) and has launched multiple 7 figure courses. He spent the last 4 years as a Product Manager at Facebook where he patented half a dozen AI technologies. He graduated Summa Cum Laude from Cornell University. [**Jason Goodison**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonlevigoodison/) **(CTO)** is a Software Engineer and [Tech YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@JasonGoodison) with 138k subscribers. Before YC, he worked at Microsoft for 3 years and graduated with distinction from the University of Waterloo. ### **❌ The Problem** **The average completion rate for online courses is below 9%** because they are not designed for our short attention spans. Oftentimes courses are 20+ hours of content, but only contain 1-2 hours of actionable insights. Students don't want to consume long-winded lectures. **Today’s generation wants to learn from their favorite creators!** We asked over a hundred top creators what was holding them back from creating a course. The top cited reasons were: 1. The time commitment required to script and film a traditional video course 2. Not knowing where to start and how to effectively monetize a course 3. Worries about piracy of video-on-demand courses 4. Not being able to coach each student to the extent they’d like because their time doesn’t scale   Courses allow creators massive monetization potential without dependence on advertisers; however, **many of the best creators are deterred from selling information products altogether because no platform today fits their needs.** ## **✨ Our Solution** [**Pair**](https://www.pairai.com/) **is the first mobile video course platform built by creators, for creators.** We are removing all the barriers holding creators back from launching information products. **Our platform is specifically designed for structured learning through shorter**\\-**form video** with our average video length being about 5 minutes. We pride ourselves on offering more actionable insights through 2 hours of total video than traditional courses provide in 20 hours. Not only is this a much better experience for students, but it also lowers the burden on creators to launch their courses.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69766&key=user_uploads/1052399/1dddeb6d-e65d-4066-9654-71ce177db429) **Unlike other platforms, we only make money when our creators make money.** Creators keep a generous 90% of sales and we take 10%. With this alignment of incentives, our product roadmap prioritizes helping course creators maximize their long-term revenue above all else. Our out-of-box white label solution optimizes specifically for course sales and helps any creator seamlessly launch their course and craft a world-class sales funnel. We have handcrafted this experience after spending the last 4 years launching multiple 7 figure courses ourselves.   **Our platform also allows any creator or educator access to powerful engagement tools like streaks, badges, and leaderboards** to create daily habit and build a lucrative and retentive content business. These tools were previously reserved for unicorn companies like Duolingo, Calm, and Headspace with large in-house engineering teams until we decided to democratize them 🙂 **Pair also offers robust tooling to prevent ripping of your content** and to actively search for and file takedown requests on the off chance piracy does occur. As course creators ourselves, we know firsthand how terrifying piracy is. A ripped copy of your course getting SEO’d to Google could cut your sales in half or worse overnight. Astonishingly, not a single course platform today offers even the most basic anti-piracy solutions—until now. And last but not least, **Pair offers best-in-class AI assistance to help you provide 1:1 coaching and personalized learning assistance to your students at scale.** We do this by ingesting a creator's entire back-catalog of content to craft a chatbot that is fine-tuned to sound exactly like them. Creators can also use this chat experience to deliver push notifications and live content updates to students to support their learning process! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69766&key=user_uploads/1052399/09f2a0b0-ad6e-40d5-bb6c-a55baa60ffe8) ### **🙏 Ask** **If there’s someone in your network with a large audience who is looking to launch a course,** [**please introduce us.**](https://team@pairai.com)",Parth Detroja,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/ae96040e4a04ab90c0f10f4f54d6f82770397abe.jpg,Otherimage_27754_1.jpg;Otherimage_27754_2.jpg;Otherimage_27754_3.jpg;,27754
Cloudchipr - Zapier for your clouds,"### **TL;DR Instead of wasting runway on the cloud, sweating about your bottom line and limiting your developers, let Cloudchipr take care of optimizing your cloud usage and getting the most out of it.** Hey everyone we are the founders of [Cloudchipr](https://cloudchipr.com/) 🙂 ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69761&key=user_uploads/1159850/9a6a6c4e-e473-4927-823b-28d84a6d8e1f) **Ashot** (left) managed some of the largest cloud infrastructures in the world. A distributed computing systems and cloud guru, who can smell coffee ☕ and sniff expensive infrastructures 📈 from at least 1000 feet away 😄 **Suren** (right) worked on platforms serving 100,000,000s users from all over the world while at Picsart, AWS and Wayfair. A foodie with the power of Spring Boot as his spirit animal 🐩 😄 We got a lot of battle scars figuring out what’s the best way to operate your cloud. Now we’ve built Cloudchipr so that you don’t have to! 🚀 ### ❌ **The Problem** All clouds make it very easy to start using resources. That’s how they are designed and that’s why they won. Problem is, that freedom very quickly turns into a mess eventually hurting the bottom line and becoming an operational hurdle. **Where it hurts Product and Engineering:** * Services and resources sprawl out of control across various geographies and cloud regions. * Resources get wasted to ensure developer convenience (dev machines run over weekends, holidays and non-working hours alike). * Routine operational maintenance becomes a burden and a time consuming activity for expensive DevOps and SRE engineers. * Every launched resource in the cloud becomes a monument - once it’s there no one risks to touch and it lingers around forever. **Where it hurts the Business side:** * Accountability and trackability becomes an issue: ask any series B (or later stage) company startup CFO how much a particular project costs on a cloud and see them roll their eyes. * Cloud is treated as a black box. Although being one of the largest cost centres finance has little visibility into what is actually going on. They are expected to foot the bill with 0 insights or understanding how the money is actually spent. * Very hard to forecast spend and act on if it gets out of hand. ### **🪄 The Solution** Watch our [Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QLy74eGnLg) Cloudchipr is an AWS qualified SaaS platform (we also support GCP and Azure) which provides a suite of powerful tools for cost tracking, resource management, and automation. It simplifies cloud operations, streamlines DevOps workflows while giving financial visibiliy, predictability and control.  ✅ **Cost Optimization by granular cost tracking and reporting.** It allows to monitor cloud expenses in real-time and optimize their usage to reduce waste.  ✅ **Resource Management:** Cloudchipr provides a centralized dashboard that provides full visibility into their cloud infrastructure across all geographies and cloud regions. ✅ **Automation workflows:** Cloudchipr's automation features enable teams to streamline their DevOps workflows and automate routine operational tasks. With Cloudchipr, businesses can set up notifications and actions based on their criteria and free up valuable time and resources for other important tasks. **For example:** * If a resource is underutilized, Cloudchipr will notify the owner to take an action. * If there are resources without an owner, a slack message will be sent. * Stops expensive GPU nodes based on configurable usage criteria (e.g. idle more than 3 hours) * Stops/Starts the selected dev databases and virtual machines at night and on weekends * Takes care about resources being properly tagged. ✅ **LAST BUT NOT LEAST:** It’s 2023, so you should be able to talk to your cloud and your cloud should talk back!  We are launching the first version of **CloudChat -** an interactive Natural-Language interface for querying, reporting and setting automations for your cloud.  Cloudchipr automates the cloud cost saving and reporting, and helps the finance and engineering departments save money and time by removing the friction around the costs saving. We do that by automation workflows which constantly check all the cloud resources, take configurable actions and report about the progress. ### **Get started now:** * Try it for free at [cloudchipr.com](http://cloudchipr.com)",Ashot Ayvazyan,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/fe6ea3ce3726f0c9fa1ebc05768051bdf61e64d1.jpg,Otherimage_27844_1.jpg;,27844
Doctor Droid: Proactively detect issues before it impacts your customers,"Hello everyone, Sid & Dipesh here from Doctor Droid! Tl;dr: We help engineers track complex backend workflows that cannot be seen with just a single trace. Our stateful alerting system proactively looks for “missing states”, which means you’ll be alerted even when a certain task or event does not take place. ### Our Story Dipesh & I are tinkerers who love to build products, and build them fast.

Vellum - Build production-worthy LLM applications,"**TL;DR** [Vellum](http://vellum.ai) (W23) is a developer platform for building production-worthy applications on LLMs like @OpenAI’s GPT-3 or @Anthropic’s Claude. Use Vellum to save hours on prompt engineering, iterate on prompts in production confidently, and continuously fine-tune for better results (we helped one customer save 94% of their LLM costs through fine-tuning!). Request early access [here](https://www.vellum.ai/landing-pages/request-early-access). — Hi everyone, Akash, Noa and Sidd here. We worked together at Dover (YC S19) for 2+ years where we built production use-cases of Large Language Models (LLMs). Noa and Sidd are MIT engineers who previously worked at DataRobot’s MLOps team and Quora’s ML Platform team respectively. We decided to work on Vellum after realizing that while the MLOps industry has matured rapidly for traditional ML, companies using LLMs don’t have any of this tooling available. Engineering teams spend many hours building custom internal tooling to tame LLMs, taking away time from building their core product. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69757&key=user_uploads/1020427/c77e40f4-74d7-49b8-89cf-650548274362) # # **The LLM Management Problem** We’ve seen companies building production applications with Large Language Models experience challenges at all stages: 1. **Going from 0 → 1:** ”Prompt engineering” has become an important role in working with LLMs. Today, most people experiment with various prompts across browser tabs and the more diligent track the results of their experimentation in spreadsheets. Rarely do people take the time to test each variant across a sufficient number of test cases, let alone try different parameter combinations and LLM providers. Most settle for a sub-optimal configuration because the testing process is so tedious. Querying for semantically relevant context against a corpus of text to inject in the prompt is another large barrier for many people just getting started. 2. **Managing changes once live in production:** Tracking model & prompt versions, keeping an audit log of inputs/outputs, testing changes to prompts/models before going into production, and measuring aggregate quality metrics are all critical for a production-worthy system, but all require custom code and non-trivial internal tooling. Engineers don’t have time to build out this tooling and instead, fly blind – never sure what their current baseline for quality is or whether “improvements” made to their prompts will in fact break existing behavior. 3. **Post-MVP optimization:** Most people find a semi-reasonable prompt for _text-davinci-003_ and move on. But, they also acknowledge that with more time, they could set up a fine-tuning pipeline, experiment with other models/LLM providers, and try out new foundation models as they’re released to maximize output quality while dramatically reducing LLM provider spend. They’re paying a premium for sub-optimal quality and risk falling behind as new models are released. # # **The Vellum Product** We have 3 products – each aimed to solve the problems we identified when building production LLM apps ourselves. ### **Vellum Playground: Super powers for prompt engineers** Create one “sandbox” per LLM use-case. In each, you can try as many prompt variants as you like across as many test cases as you wish. These prompt variants may differ in their text, underlying model, model parameters (e.g. “temperature”), and even LLM provider! Each run is saved as a history item and has a permanent url you can use share with teammates and track results. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69757&key=user_uploads/1020427/3a844278-c463-456f-ae0a-566ecbd29153) ## **Vellum Manage: Confidently iterate on models in production** Once you’ve settled on a prompt you like, you “deploy” it through Vellum. Vellum acts as a high-reliability, low-latency proxy layer between you and LLM providers. Every request is captured and persisted in one-place, providing observability into your model’s performance. Because the API interface doesn’t change, you can update your prompt (and even the underlying LLM provider!) without making any code changes. Previously made requests can be replayed against proposed changes to gain confidence prior to updating a deployment. All updates are version-controlled and you can revert to prior versions at any time. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69757&key=user_uploads/1020427/437adec7-b675-459c-8148-fe7600c20c41) ## **Vellum Optimize: Continuously fine-tune to improve quality and lower cost** Once you’ve collected data in production for some time through Vellum Manage, these input/output pairs (minimum 100, but depends on the use case), can be used to fine-tune your own proprietary models for better quality, lower cost, or lower latency. Your data and your models become a powerful competitive moat. Vellum periodically runs model evaluation jobs in the background to see if we can find a different model that works even better for your use case. If one is identified, you can swap models under-the-hood – no code changes needed! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69757&key=user_uploads/1020427/72d1eb55-ddc8-4512-b674-1e409c4eb608) P.S: If you’re curious, we recently published a blog where you can learn more about the benefits of fine-tuning and how to do it. Check it out [here](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/what-is-fine-tuning-and-when-to-use-it). ### **Trusted by companies on the bleeding edge of AI** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1020427/f3a6ea0a-6b88-4b9c-81a6-8a4770e42e0f) ## **Our ask** * Visit [our website](http://vellum.ai) to learn more, [request early access](https://www.vellum.ai/landing-pages/request-early-access) if any of these problems resonate with you! * Spread the word!

Upfront ⚡️ - Turning rebates into instantly lower prices,"# tl;dr Upfront helps merchants that sell clean energy products by turning billions of dollars of rebates into dramatically lower prices at checkout. Instead of filling out paperwork and waiting 6 months for a check, our software instantly applies rebates and manages the settlement in the background. # The Problem Clean energy products have higher upfront costs while competing in markets defined by the importance of affordability (e.g. 60% of appliances are financed). Rebates are designed to offset these higher costs, but because rebates are complicated and not surfaced during buying decisions, consumers today choose products that are worse for both the environment and their wallets. # The Solution We solve this problem by partnering with retailers to enable them to transform government and utility rebates into dramatically lower prices for their customers. This solution saves consumers money, increases retailer sales, and helps deploy rebates faster than ever. Starting with EV Chargers, we qualify consumers for all applicable rebate programs in real-time and advance their savings at checkout. After purchase, we work with the consumer to process the rebate and manage the settlement with the rebate issuer. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69740&key=user_uploads/1202385/15a9b94d-59cc-4ebd-9cd8-2e27ba1df34a) # The Team ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69740&key=user_uploads/1202385/124cba11-ebdf-48b4-b7c4-56a3fa67421a) We’ve both spent the last half decade helping merchants grow their businesses. Andrew was an engineer at Affirm, building servicing and payment systems scaling to billions of dollars in GMV. Thomas launched and GM’d markets for DoorDash both domestically and abroad.  As new homeowners we were both struggling to figure out what rebates were available and how they actually worked… and we’d spent weeks researching climate tech! Fellow consumers and retailers agreed, so in January of 2023, we started Upfront. We're determined to help make clean energy products the obvious choice for consumers to stamp out the nearly 1 gigaton of CO2E emitted from America’s 124 million homes annually. # The Ask * If you sell a product that receives government and/or utility rebates (especially EV chargers)–we’d love to chat!

Orchid – The most efficient EHR for independent mental health professionals,"### **Tl;dr:** _[_Orchid_](https://orchid.health) is an Electronic Health Record (EHR) for independent mental health professionals that saves clinicians’ time, money, and frustration. We do this by integrating core administrative workflows, streamlining clinical processes, and automating manual flows. Altogether, Orchid practitioners reclaim \\~500+ hours of their time spent on administrative work, with the potential to save $11B in healthcare costs annually._ ### _Would you or anyone in your network be interested in learning more or helping out? [**Connect with us**](mailto:founders@orchid.health)_   ### **The Problem**  Did you know that **mental health professionals** spend more time on their EHR than they do with their patients? In fact, they **lose 500 hours a year** by clicking around terrible infrastructure and as a result the **healthcare industry loses $11 billion annually**. Mental health clinicians face the following set of challenges: 1. Subpar EHR solutions cost mental health clinicians \\~1,500 hours/year 2. This admin time detracts from time spent with patients, translating into $10,000+ of lost revenue per clinician 3. Lost revenue and less time with patients leads to stress and ultimately to clinician burnout  No wonder it’s so hard to find a therapist these days, and it all starts with clunky software!  At Orchid we believe the path to helping those seeking mental health care runs through helping mental health clinicians. We need to figure out an affordable way to buy back the time of these mental health professionals because every hour wasted is an hour not spent addressing the mountain of unmet demand in this market and results in billions wasted for our healthcare industry.  ### **The Solution** Enter Orchid. **We are an affordable EHR that seamlessly integrates the core functions of running a mental healthcare practice.**  Imagine an all-in-one platform that automates scheduling, billing, insurance credentialing, analytics, telehealth, and note-taking. By doing this **we reclaim 500 hours of each provider annually, and we potentially save the healthcare industry 11 billion dollars**.  Orchid not only helps clinicians improve the mental health outcomes of their patients but also alleviates the supply-demand imbalance in the mental healthcare market by enabling clinicians to spend more time both onboarding new patients and focusing on their current patient roster. **Read what Orchid subscribers are saying about how Orchid reduces their admin work**: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69725&key=user_uploads/1179470/fddba9d9-d1b1-42f8-859c-c0ec794570c7) ### **Make the world a better place** **If you or anyone in your network might be interested in learning more or helping out, we would love to chat.**  We're especially interested in talking with: * **Health insurance companies (payors)**, especially those interested in expanding their mental health offerings, in increasing their members’ access to mental healthcare, in decreasing their costs through efficient operations, and in improving their quality of care. **We have hundreds of vetted clinicians implementing measurement-based care.** * **Independent mental health professionals**: therapists, social workers, psychologists, and psychiatrists, even if they’re currently not in the market for a new EHR.

Warp – Modern payroll and compliance for startups,"Hey, my name is Ayush Sharma, and today we’re launching [Warp](https://www.joinwarp.com/) – a modern compliance and payroll stack built for founders to easily run their startups. Warp automates mandatory compliance that existing solutions don't – including state tax registrations, unemployment insurance, annual reports, ongoing notices, and more. With Warp, founders can confidently hire, onboard, and pay their team no matter where they are. We launched 4 weeks ago, and are already running payroll and simplifying compliance for several YC and non-YC startups. We are already processing tens of thousands of $$ in payroll, and you can hear what customers are saying about Warp, [here](https://www.joinwarp.com/#reviews). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69710&key=user_uploads/1247031/905c45cc-813b-48c9-8839-a47f046aaa12) ### **Problem** As a startup founder, you want to focus on building your product, not trudging through CA or NY state department websites to learn about obscure regulations on how to pay your team in those places. * **Existing payroll solutions don’t handle compliance:** You sign up for payroll, believe that your work is done, only to start getting countless emails about this or that compliance work you need to do. There are state tax registrations, foreign qualifications, unemployment insurance, ongoing reports to file, and franchise taxes, to name a few. * **Distributed startups = MORE compliance:** In the US, each state has 3 different obscure agencies you need to register with. Today’s startups are often spread out across multiple states like CA, NY, WA, and FL, compounding this compliance burden. * **Software designed for HR heads:** in 2023, as incumbents have ossified, their software has become bloated, full of upsells you don’t need, forcing you to go through multiple back-and-forth sales calls just to get started. ### **Solution** Enter Warp. First, we onboard your company, collecting all the necessary information we’ll need to automate your compliance and your payroll ops, in just 10 mins. Next, our Warp handles the most common (and frustrating) parts of the payroll process such as registering with state tax agencies, obtaining certificates of good standing, helping with foreign qualifications, and monitoring upcoming deadlines. Warp allows you to run fully-automated payroll, built to cover everything your startup needs – * **US W2 employees** in all 50 states (we file federal, state, and local tax returns). * **US 1099 contractors** in all 50 states. * **International contractors in 150+ countries** (we provide robust contracts localized for all geographies and support payouts in international currencies) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69710&key=user_uploads/1247031/7fc8f358-8dde-4d4c-b9e1-59e3a27115ff) ### **Why us?** We’re a team of 3 engineers. I’m the founder and CEO, and I work with two brilliant full-time engineers – Adam Rankin (founding engineer) and Olzhas B (founding designer/front-end engineer). Previously, I was at MIT where I did my undergrad and master’s in Computer Science. In my last startup, I hired and ran a fully distributed team – multiple US states + multiple countries. Two things quickly became clear to me. 1. The future of startups is distributed. After COVID, in 2023, we’re still only at the beginning of this revolution. 2. The compliance burden sucks, and it falls on founders’ shoulders at a time when they’d rather do anything else than have to navigate government red tape. With Warp, I’m building the product I wish I had in my previous startup. ### **Our asks** If you or someone you know might be a fit for Warp, ping me at [ayush@joinwarp.com](mailto:ayush@joinwarp.com). **The next 10 customers signing up to Warp will get the exclusive YC discount!**",Ayush Sharma,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/2cac2152c0037c84e53d607c348b2c0e98e5f88a.jpg,Otherimage_28369_1.jpg;Otherimage_28369_2.jpg;,28369

Metal: Helping developers easily implement machine learning embeddings,"tl;dr _Metal makes it easy for developers to implement machine learning embeddings. With embeddings, we help businesses create value from unstructured data like images, text documents, videos and more._ Hey everyone! We’re Taylor, James, and Sergio and we’re building [Metal.](https://www.getmetal.io/?utm_campaign=pre-launch&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=YC) ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BAmRW6DjuFBKZwKTqlBZ3usUOyMeRtO_c34yip0WO65CQX-VCS3IeNXKPOE57AdV-HApI_CC0QjqVgurwEDxHJSDo9BxV5Pve7VXz20yulLPBNYbSKHQXqSxhLowmbYOUlQ7c3sln6lJ4eRTuVMRmL0) **What’s the problem?** Embeddings are super powerful but they’re too hard to use. We learned this the hard way while building machine learning products at companies like Spotify and Meta. Getting to production for simple features (or so we thought) was incredibly painful. The team would put weeks into offline training only for the data to be stale in production. It was difficult to iterate on models without versioning. Fine-tuning was highly inefficient. When we finally did get a model deployed there were immediate scaling concerns. It once took us 6 frustrating months to ship a simple embedding classification feature 🤦 Companies shouldn’t need to reinvent the wheel to use embeddings. **What’s the solution?** Metal gives you all the tools you need to quickly and easily implement embeddings against your data in production.  * We integrate with your data sources * We generate and store your embeddings * We provide real time indexing and search APIs * We provide versioning * And we make it easier to fine tune embeddings via Metal’s API or SDKs You can get started in as little as five minutes. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/izlgcDfSdm-FgMwj8Cns-nsnN2GmkAuUtdsSCQKuLawBY0fcv3KZjgkjiwxa7yiOpbPOnNZs_uN9ERNmCS8ZVVP3IC-NY-qHBe1cuipof9D7JKskIn6FvN-BSuYULjJGJPb6xYyi3e47OUDZ2qm9c4U) ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nOmwv8oD-qYgxa_m6enimIFMTirXP1olznsJv1UrojbT2lf69WdR0vxc2xLkX8TceIfAusPKPFopsM2vjXcGXIJMDMHQz9lgJhmxPr2qcOI3uS5_b7LI44k1HvaYeFSF2uGvHp1fpgMzuqVsU31sNaA) **Ok so it’s easy to use, but what about some real world use cases?** * Better personalization for your users through behavioral clustering * Search and compare similarities between data types, such as images or videos * Understand how your customers feel by classifying their free text reviews * Make the most of internal resources by supporting semantic search of text documents, PDFs, call notes and more **Our ask:** 1. [**Sign up for early access**](https://www.getmetal.io/?utm_campaign=pre-launch&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=YC) and we will get in touch! [You can also book a time here to learn more](https://calendly.com/metal-taylor/metal-30-minutes-landing?utm_campaign=pre-launch&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=YC). 2. **Introduce us to companies** who could use Metal. We mostly work with small to medium size companies (10-200 people) who have raised a series A. These companies have an embeddings use case but don’t want to spend the time/resources to build it from scratch. 3. **Help us build the future** :) If you’re experienced with embeddings and want them to be simpler, then we’d love to hear from you.

🌿 Dill - Faster payments in foodservice distribution,"Hi everyone! Excited to launch [Dill](https://usedill.com/) 🤠 **What we do** Dill is a digital invoicing & payments tool for foodservice distributors.  **The problem** Foodservice distributors are processing hundreds of invoices each day. Their biggest pain today is late payments. Restaurants often pay late due to missing invoices and proof of delivery. This is because of the way invoicing is done today – it’s still rooted in paper.  **The solution** At Dill, we’re bringing the invoicing & payments process online, and we’re built specifically for the unique workflows of the food supply chain. With us, our customers have gotten paid 20% faster and gotten 20 hours per week back on new sales & better customer service.  ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/KxWNLoQzLq6zbnAe05wfz564uhonBCmELjcZ4TeLnGyEGShYsdLonW7UHcgb5pXlyZy0RpXwqaPeHsxc1Mn5LlxKZ7fcehZatJoVxEHrNlff0gjnUIVtnddmCEg933BdaJoobQCgRVvnrod2MpTSwQ) **Our backstory** I’m a second-time founder, and b2b commerce is my bread and butter. My last startup in b2b commerce was acquired, so this isn’t my first rodeo! I have always been passionate about the food supply chain – I previously was a PM at Yelp and have always been a huge foodie 😋 **The asks** 🥦 Would appreciate any **warm leads to foodservice distributors**. If you know someone or know someone who knows someone, reach out at [catherine@usedill.com](mailto:catherine@usedill.com)! 💵 Ping me if you’re also building in AR/AP.

Kraftful – ChatGPT for product research,"**TLDR**\\ Having led product teams at companies big and teensy, I’m excited to share a solution to involve masses of users directly in the development process to build products people love 🥰 Would love for you to try it out ([free trial](https://www.kraftful.com/)) and provide feedback. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69687&key=user_uploads/331211/b2936511-7594-4003-8f64-3cbe849f5198) ### **Problem** Being a product lead before starting Kraftful, one of my teams’ biggest challenges was to manually gather insights from user interviews, app store reviews, support tickets, sales calls, and really anywhere else our millions of users wanted to give us an earful 😅 Even with thousands of users, it can take hundreds of hours to try to parse through everything. It’s impossible to quickly act on all this data. Just like \\*NSYNC, users who don't feel heard end up saying \""bye bye bye” 💔💔 ### **Solution** Now imagine if you had the tools to effectively listen to users and make them feel heard – that would advance product development AND user satisfaction because they’d be actively engaged in the development process.  With Kraftful, you can:  ✅ Connect a source (e.g. iOS/Android app store reviews, Zendesk, Intercom, Front) or paste user interview notes, call transcripts, or other relevant text 👀 Check out the instant summaries of frequent feature requests, common complaints, most loved app features, and lists of mentioned competitors 💡 Ask follow-up questions with our ChatGPT-like assistant to uncover insights like “what do users say about X feature” or “how do users currently complete this task” 💪 Use these insights to build or refine your product roadmap This is not your mother’s AI summarization tool 😅 We’re building a solution for product teams to help them connect with users in new ways. Today’s launch is the first step toward that vision. ### **Sign up for a free trial** [Give it a try!](https://www.kraftful.com/) User feedback is our jam, so let us know what you think at [feedback@kraftful.com](mailto:feedback@kraftful.com)✨ While we’re launching in Beta, we’ve seen incredible demand for our solution. The product in Alpha has already been used by thousands of product builders from companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, Canva, Dropbox, Atlassian, LinkedIn, Oracle, Kayak, Volvo, Johnson & Johnson, the National Art Gallery, London Underground, 7-Eleven, and many others 🔥🔥🔥",Yana Welinder,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0e5d63bea02c5d76b2ceeacb637f7de78a5dad44.jpg,Otherimage_12550_1.jpg;,12550
🟪 Resync: Inbox Zero for PMs and Eng Managers who are feeling swamped,"### **TLDR** **‧˚₊** Resync helps you maintain \""inbox zero\"" on the changes across all your project files, giving you the freedom to think creatively and strategically again! **₊˚⊹** ### **The problem** As a product or eng leader, you’re responsible for both ensuring delivery of current work _and_ steering future work, but just keeping up with what’s happening across your projects can be its own full-time job. With team conversations and decisions split across dozens of files and several services, there's always more digging you can do. The creative, fun, and long-term valuable part of your job falls to the bottom of the priority list in favor of constantly scouring team comms and files for problems. ### **The solution** ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/VSHcBr2m4OT-KtJGdz3_YBdhySNEBS9Gh_qmEGBYzuO_M63G4rNPjq4d-sL5sH1OGTyqRfEDG5aaF1wIMS5popup30NG-p0C9U5uxI0PiPSRZwnJJArMc1BmydulUv19qQU6RkHL48MULLJs2lmECes) Resync is a ProductOps platform that enables individual managers, teams, or entire organizations to detect and resolve problems in their product development lifecycle. It integrates directly with the tools your team is already using to produce a dashboard of \""changes since I last looked\"" across all your project files. Resync also proactively alerts you to potential problems, like a Slack debate that's active for more than 3 days or a PRD getting rewritten after development has started. _\\[List of supported services in the FAQ\\]_ ## **The team** ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Wn_jdE9fef_nmS49eGUC6fsfQIkiMBjp50WRrdJxc46KXmO5IvjeJ9MjW6pPMR3V7NjjaPCA6aXy9Uzl5AADfrv78EDOMnW97DzhQpXUBaQEw61n4hz5WFvM3qkS0mdXnLQnvjRSVzO_VQZE8F3t_5M) We're an ex-Palantir duo with years of experience managing product teams, sometimes spanning up to 6 timezones. Jason is an engineer, second-time founder, and Thiel Fellow. He most recently led a product team responsible for expanding Palantir Foundry's data security and data governance capabilities. Ethan is a designer, engineer, and people-organizer. He most recently led a series of strategic product initiatives at Palantir to capture key customers and enter the company into new domains including energy production, cyber defense, and life sciences research. ## **The ask** We're bringing on 10 more teams/managers to our early access program. We’ll work closely with you to refine the views and workflows you need to restore your sanity! Register your interest here: [https://resync.ai/interest](https://resync.ai/interest?utm_source=yc&utm_campaign=launchyc) and we’ll reach out to you this week. ══════════════════ ### **FAQ** **How hard is setup and maintenance?** **Easy.** You drop our Slackbot into your Slack channel and we'll generate a dashboard from the files your team is talking about (after you confirm they’re project-related resources and not memes!) **Why now?** \\- Remote/hybrid work makes it hard to passively track what the team is struggling with and dramatically increases the cost of \""just checking in\""-type conversations. \\- The macroeconomic situation means companies are trying to squeeze more output from the same, or even fewer, people. Managers will need systems and tools to meet this demand. **Which services do you support?** * **Communication tools:** Slack * **Document tools:** Google Docs, Notion, Quip * **Design tools:** Figma * **Issue trackers:** Github, Asana, Jira, Linear * **Version control:** Github We’re always adding more, so let us know what you need!",Ethan Bond,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/d28ce456739ca85ecada4c62bfdb403d09b3a4f0.jpg,,27696
Miracle - Speeding up clinical trials 💊,"**TL;DR** Miracle helps biotech and pharma companies accelerate clinical trials by connecting all patient recruitment data sources. Each day of a clinical trial that Miracle’s software can help shave off is worth on average $2M in additional patent-covered revenue opportunity. Hi everyone! My name is Jin, and I’m the Founder & CEO of Miracle. When I was competing for medals as a former athlete on the USA Archery Team, I used to aim my bow and arrow down at a target 70 meters away. Today, I have my eyes set on improving healthcare by bringing science to life and into hands of patients more quickly. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69664&key=user_uploads/985589/5efd5b1c-4740-45b5-88b5-9824dd2ce30b) ### **The Problem** Biotech and pharmaceutical companies (“sponsors”) must run clinical trials (phase 1-3) in order to get FDA approval to market their drug. The **average cost to bring a new drug to market is >$2B**, and clinical trials can take up **7-10 years** of a 20-year patent window. Over **80% of clinical trials are delayed** from patient recruitment, but vendors and clinics do not play along nor provide the transparency necessary for sponsors to account for ROI and, ultimately, runway. Today, Clinical Operations teams within biotech companies spend **15% of their time manually compiling information** from multiple vendor portals and creating visualizations to report up to management and the board on the study progress – all of which take valuable time that they could be using to focus on improving the study operations. However, the bigger problem is that without transparent consolidated reporting, **they have no choice but to throw money at vendors and research sites** in hopes of recruiting patients quickly. They have a hard time optimizing the millions of dollars spent each year in a way that would actually expedite their trial. ### **The Solution** Miracle is a **one-stop shop** for biotech/pharma to fully automate and consolidate their clinical trial reporting needs. We integrate with their vendors and research sites to **eliminate time wasted** on aggregating metrics and compiling reports, **free up their time** to focus on patient recruitment, and make it possible to **optimize ROI on vendors and sites** that are meaningfully speeding up the trial. ### Examples from Miracle ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69664&key=user_uploads/985589/3de6c2ca-0f94-45de-97d7-a781f5228494) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69664&key=user_uploads/985589/03be693f-8201-4534-aee3-050853ee439a) ### Our Ask * If you’re at a biotech company running a clinical trial, we’d love to chat with you. * Any intros to biotech/pharma reps (especially in Clinical Operations) would be greatly appreciated.",Jin Kim,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/8119c3ecc1e3ae42e613b39440b0ffd6c05fc167.jpg,Otherimage_27671_1.jpg;Otherimage_27671_2.jpg;Otherimage_27671_3.jpg;,27671

CodeParrot 🦜 - Automate API Testing using production traffic,"**TL;DR** [CodeParrot](https://www.codeparrot.ai/) uses production traffic to generate intelligent test cases. What’s more? It can mock downstream dependencies like databases, external APIs, so you don’t need to set up a test environment to run these tests. If this sounds useful, **book a demo** [**here**](https://calendly.com/royaljain0203/30min) to learn more **📅** **About Us** Hello everyone! We’re Royal and Vedant and we couldn’t be more thrilled to introduce CodeParrot to our fellow devs! **Problem**\\ Nobody likes writing tests. Why? Additional work, needs maintenance, requires setting up test environments, mocking 😩. What's there to like? **Solution**\\ Codeparrot captures API calls from the production environment - both requests made to your backend service and downstream calls which the service makes (like database calls, third party APIs etc). This data is used to generate test cases. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/329126/592ba381-8fa6-4d0b-9fdf-57c3aa0626d2) Whenever the service is updated, we run the service in an isolated container. We replay the test cases and compare the responses with the responses captured in production. All the downstream services are mocked and regressions are highlighted to the developers. Sounds Interesting? Checkout our [Demo Video](https://www.loom.com/share/dd6c12e23ceb43f587814a2fbc165c1f). ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/329126/0519dc8a-d821-42ea-bd60-f13a0e79ca67) Codeparrot is a auto-updating test suite for your backend services. **Our Ask - Give us a chance 🚀** We want you!

Pierre - A new way to review code,"Hi Everyone — We are Ian and Jacob, and we are on a mission to modernize code reviews. Sign up for the alpha on [**HeyPierre.app**](http://heypierre.app/) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/46928/b1f1d6e0-88b1-4a2e-b17c-0d5982d2543d) Jacob (CEO) and Ian (CTO) met as early engineers at Twitter 14 years ago. Jacob is the co-creator of Bootstrap (one of the largest and most popular open source communities on GitHub) and later went on to work as one of the first engineers at Medium. Ian was the first intern at Twitter, dropping out of college at 19 to TL the Twitter platform team. Jacob and Ian co-founded a mobile app called Bumpers in 2016, which was eventually acquired by Coinbase. For the next 5 years, they led the Product Platform team at Coinbase and were the company-wide web and mobile DRIs. ### Github doesn’t solve today’s biggest engineering problems In the decade+ since Github was built, tools that prioritize real time collaboration and discussion (Figma, Notion, and Linear) have exploded in popularity, but the circa-2006 code review experience hasn’t materially changed. We’re building a new way to review code, and we’re starting with pull requests. As engineers with more than 15 years of experience, we’ve seen firsthand how cumbersome a pull request review is using Github — often, pull requests lack necessary context, take too long to approve, and cannot be viewed by non-engineers for feedback. Github’s comment features make it difficult to manage a conversation over time, and discussion is lost when engineers switch to Slack or Hangouts. ### Your code, conversations, and collaborators. Together. Pierre enables engineers to shape the way that their code is reviewed. We’re starting with two of the biggest problems that engineers have: 1. How do you set better context? 2. How do you better manage discussions? We’re taking features of the products you love most — the organized chats of iMessage, the real time collaboration of Figma, and the narrative structure of Notion — and we’re bringing it to code reviews. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/46928/2f0b02fe-d44b-4605-a704-f66aa7736c4f) Using Pierre, code review creators can: * Set context next to the code * Reorganize diffs intuitively * Break up large pull requests into digestible bites And code reviewers can: * Be anyone — no more waiting for the bug bash to get design and product feedback * Comment on anything — code, images or text * Conduct real-time conversations right next to the code * Get up-to-speed on changes more quickly ### Why we built Pierre We’ve been intimately using GitHub since it’s inception (Ian’s user id is #91). There’s been a lot to love about GitHub over the years, but innovation on the core experience is lagging and other pieces of our toolchain are making us expect more. This is only exasperated by Ian living in NYC and Jacob in SF. Engineers deserve a realtime, collaborative software platform optimized for productivity - instead of a slow, feed-based social network for coding. ### Try Pierre Out! * Head to [**HeyPierre.app**](http://heypierre.app/) and sign up for our waitlist. We’re in closed alpha, but we can’t wait for you to try us out. * We’re looking for a handful of fast growing teams (with \\~25-50 engineers) to pilot us.

Lasso 🤠 - Robotic process automation for Chrome using ChatGPT and computer vision,"### **TLDR: Traditional automation software is slow and expensive, Lasso is 10X faster and 1/10th the price. It lets operations teams automate using natural language.** Howdy y’all! Lucas here from [Lasso](https://www.getlassoai.com/) - excited to share what my cofounder Gautam and I have been working on! **🧐 The problem: Traditional Robotic Process Automation is slow and expensive.** It’s extremely time consuming and expensive to build out robot process automations using traditional tools like UiPath (\\~$66,000 per yearly license - Yikes!) not to mention the initial consultant setup fees which most people are forced to pay if they don’t have the resources in house (at the lowest end we’re talking $50,000+ per project - Double Yikes!!) 💡 **Our Solution: Lasso makes it 10X cheaper and faster to build any robotic process automation using natural language on chrome.** We’re solving this by creating a platform that enables robotics process automation for Chrome using large language models and computer vision. Currently our customers send us descriptions or videos of the processes they’d like us to automate and we use our internal tooling to quickly build out those automations.

🏠 Marble — An automated property manager for $50/mo,"Hello everyone! We are [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dli123/) and [Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dankim714/) building [Marble](https://www.rentmarble.com/?utm_source=yc), a $50/mo flat fee rental manager. Marble is an alternative to traditional property managers that are costly, antiquated, and frankly not that good. We have built processes, automation, and machine learning that brings the cost of managing a rental property down by an order of magnitude. We are launching Marble now with 800+ units under management across all 50 states (even Alaska)! ## What do we cover? **Automated Leasing:** Once a smart-lock is installed on your property, we take care of listing and answering questions to self-guided touring and lease signing, all completely with software. **24/7 Maintenance:** We have a 24/7/365 operations center (with real humans) that can take care of your leaking pipes at 3AM or your broken washing machine during the day. **Rent Collection & Financial Management:** When tenants don’t pay, we have automated late fees/reminders, as well as escalation abilities to send letters, post notices - basically everything until the eviction attorney comes into the picture. When tenants do pay, we give you nice analytics and tracking around the flow of your funds and NOI returns on your property finances. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69610&key=user_uploads/584539/47406b19-e42c-424d-8d5b-0eb76de35228) ### Pricing Marble costs **$50/month/property** with no additional fees!

💳📈 Bujeti - Corporate cards and expense management platform for African businesses,"**TL;DR:** We help African businesses in industries such as Healthcare, Logistics, Agriculture and Construction easily issue corporate cards to their employees and contractors to streamline their spendings.

This is an even a bigger problem for traditional businesses in industries like Agriculture, Logistics, Healthcare, Construction— businesses that are not tech heavy, but contribute to a big part of the GDP of most of African nations. To go around that, businesses generally have one card that they pass around which causes a lot of security, control and fraud issues. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69607&key=user_uploads/156795/062f9c7e-3473-43c3-a797-c4dfc1932fd1) # **How do we fix it?** To help fix that problem and allow African businesses to issue cards at will to their employees, while maintaining the control of their spendings, we launched Bujeti, an all-in-one corporate cards and expenses management platform. We also help them: * **Budget** their expenditures to keep their finances afloat * **Monitor** and **track** all the expenses made in the company * Facilitate **receipts** tracking and collection * Automate **Account Payables & Receivables** * Set up **spending limits and approval** flow to make sure the resources are well used and create value * **Reimburse** out of pocket expenses of their employees * **Run payroll** * Integrate their **accounting softwares**(QuickBooks, Xero, etc…) * Automate **reconciliation** and **reporting** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69607&key=user_uploads/156795/43997f82-7bf2-4595-a226-48eccb71c0db) # **How did we get here?** Achille wanted to build a personal finance and expenses management app for the African Diaspora that helps automate remittances while keeping an eye on how money sent back home was being spent. While building that, he realized the problem he was trying to solve for individuals, was in fact a problem that also affected businesses. That’s when we pivoted from B2C to B2B to solve expense management issues for African businesses. # **Our ask 🙏🏾** * Connect us to **CFO, Accountants, Country Managers** and **HR** leaders that operate in Africa in your network * Connect us to an African Logistics, Construction, Healthcare, Agriculture company in your network * Connect us VISA or Mastercard * Connect us to your CFO or Accountant to help us understand even better their needs and improve our offering * Share our post on your social media to help us increase awareness 🚀",Achille AROUKO,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/01307d9c3411ba249b3b7b3fabc88b74d656b1ea.jpg,Otherimage_27841_1.jpg;Otherimage_27841_2.jpg;Otherimage_27841_3.jpg;,27841
✨ Trigger.dev: The developer-first open source Zapier alternative,"**🔥 TL;DR** [**Trigger.dev**](https://trigger.dev?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=trigger.dev&utm_id=launch.yc) **is an** [**open source**](https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev) **platform that enables developers to effortlessly create event-driven background tasks directly in their codebase – for example, when a Stripe payment fails, open a Linear issue and send an email to yourself, or easily create a drip email campaign. Write workflows using our SDK, and view a detailed history of all runs in our web app.** Hey! We’re Matt, Dan, James and Eric, the founders of [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=trigger.dev&utm_id=launch.yc). ### **👀 The Problem:** * As developers, we find that current workflow / automation tools like Zapier, n8n or Make are great for simple tasks, but not suitable for more advanced use cases. * Developers often end up creating important workflows in no/low-code tools on behalf of non-technical team members. * Some of these tools let you drop down into code, but it’s not a great developer experience. Developers prefer using their own IDEs with version control and access to the best tools like GitHub Copilot. * Connecting together APIs in code is painful – you need to deal with authentication, lots of SDKs and docs for each API you use. * Some workflows need to use a database query or access very private data. That data shouldn’t leave your servers and you shouldn’t need to give database access to a third-party. ### **✨ Our solution:** [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=trigger.dev&utm_id=launch.yc) makes it easy to create workflows in response to API events (webhooks), on a schedule or on-demand by sending your own events. All of this lives in code alongside everything else in your codebase. We handle API authentication with external services, allowing more time to be spent writing functional code, rather than dealing with credentials. We also support long delays of up to a year that survive your server restarting. All workflow runs can be viewed in our web app providing great observability for debugging. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69600&key=user_uploads/1102924/b7793d79-dfc0-4c9f-b6d1-f4535a24f5ad) ### **🛠 How it works** * Install the [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=trigger.dev&utm_id=launch.yc) SDK to get access to our custom packages and functions * Trigger workflows from webhooks, custom events or schedules (CRON) * Use our growing library of API integrations for the best experience. We will support all of the most popular services, including Slack, Airtable, Linear, Stripe, GitHub, SendGrid, Notion and many more. We’re adding more each week with the help of our open source contributors. * Support for Fetch and subscribing to generic webhooks for any service. * Add delays of up to 1 year. Workflows will resume where they left off, even if your server has gone down. * Observe every workflow run in the app (great for debugging). * Your private data is kept private – you have control over where your data is sent. * Our open source MIT license lets anyone self-host the platform. It’s clear from our [launch](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34610686) and customers that developers want to be creating workflows in code rather than in an unfamiliar UI. We expect this trend to continue, especially with the rise of AI code writing assistants such as Copilot and Ghostwriter. Leveraging these tools will only improve [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=trigger.dev&utm_id=launch.yc) as time goes on, and make the creation of complex workflows more and more accessible to all developers. ### **🙏 Our asks** If you have a workflow you want to build and would like to try our platform - we would love to hear from you! * Try us out for free at [Trigger.dev](https://trigger.dev?utm_source=ycombinator&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=trigger.dev&utm_id=launch.yc). * Book a 15 min workflow session [here.](https://cal.com/team/triggerdotdev/15-mins-about-your-automation) * Want to migrate an existing workflow?

Resend - Email API for developers,"Hey, this is [Bu](https://twitter.com/bukinoshita) and [Zeno](https://twitter.com/zenorocha) from [Resend](https://resend.com). We're building a modern email sending platform focused on providing the best developer experience and making sure that your emails don't go to spam. We launched [7 weeks ago](https://twitter.com/zenorocha/status/1610655123063336961), and already have 6,469 people on the waitlist. Paul Graham described Resend as _“the Stripe for Email”_. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69586&key=user_uploads/360041/192c898e-24c0-470f-b5df-673f0b2ead56) ### **problem** Email sending is the kind of thing that you should integrate and forget it, but instead you have… * **Emails going to spam**: All too often emails are marked as spam even when they are legit. We believe that deliverability is a shared responsibility between the customer and the service provider, which means we work together with you to maximize email deliverability. * **Poor observability**: Most tools keep you in the dark without knowing what really happened after you sent an email. Resend exposes all the events associated with your email. * **Slow performance**: Current solutions only offer a single region for email sending (us-east-1), even when all your end users are located in another part of the world. Starting next week, we'll allow you to choose what region your emails should be sent from (Europe, LATAM, or APAC) which minimizes latency and improves time-to-inbox. * **Templates that users don't engage**: Startup teams don't have time the time to learn all the nuances of email development. We're offering a white glove service to help you implement a template that can generate better results. * **Designed for marketers only**: Existing solutions are too generic and built exclusively for product marketers and product managers. We're building a developer-first platform with a clean REST API and SDKs for Node.js, Python, Ruby, Elixir, Go, and Java. We need to stop developing emails like it’s 2010 and rethink how email can be done in 2023 and beyond. We believe that email development needs a revamp. A renovation. Modernized for the way we build apps today. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69586&key=user_uploads/360041/872480cd-c678-494c-b479-310d6eeb90a5) ### **solution** Typically, you can only send email using HTML or plain text. Although we support both, we're introducing a new way of developing and sending your emails. With Resend you can code your email using React instead of outdated HTML layouts thanks to our open source project [react.email](http://react.email) (5.1k stars on GitHub). When you're ready to send, you just need to import the component, change the props, and you're done. After sending, you can see the end result and look at how your users received that email. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69586&key=user_uploads/360041/05c80ce8-0a53-4fe9-9b75-8a8fd11d0be1) ### **why us** When I was a CPO at [Liferay](https://liferay.com/), I faced the problem of sending emails at scale. We had high-profile customers complaining about deliverability, and I've been frustrated with existing services ever since. More recently, as a VP of Developer Experience at [WorkOS](https://workos.com/), I once again had to deal with emails landing in the spam folder. After looking at all the different solutions out there, I've been obsessed with the idea of solving this problem once and for all. ### **our asks** * **Share** - talk to your friends and colleagues about Resend * **Connect** - ping me at [zeno@resend.com](mailto:zeno@resend.com) if you want to chat more * **YC companies** - you can skip the 6,469 people waitlist using the [secret link](https://resend.com/secret?ref=launchyc)",Zeno Rocha,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/66ccaad162ee56333e0f42e8bcc0d1fd19b43b4d.jpg,Otherimage_28098_1.jpg;Otherimage_28098_2.jpg;Otherimage_28098_3.jpg;,28098
Fabra: Easily integrate with your customer's data warehouse,"**TLDR:** [**Fabra**](https://www.fabra.io/) **makes it easy for B2B SaaS companies to ingest from their customer's data warehouse into their application.** Cole and Nick here— we’ll help you add this interface to your product in less than a day: ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SnXaeK0uSk1Ht-WX--sfj9Rh46In1Uxn2QsMjUFkk-M4c2RB2UAgvO8cqroNBOE2ACuT3vOlwzmoZvUIIXhbEhf37ob6A3xPNXJY0wfaZ39b6KOLGR1twoJpmxWrjGuOcBuO2CQ1Ggmmqlai9jQQkak) ### **Problem:** **As SaaS companies move upmarket, they start to encounter more customers who are blocked by data warehouse integrations.** To close these customers, companies have two options: 1. Build and maintain integrations with every data warehouse themselves. 2. Ask their customers to obtain a reverse ETL tool. Depending on the path companies choose, this can take months of development or cause them to lose customers who refuse to procure a new tool. ### **Solution:** [**Fabra**](https://fabra.io/) **provides a quick and easy solution for companies to build customer-facing data warehouse integrations**. With Fabra, you no longer have to worry about the integration process blocking your sales pipeline or taking up resources for ongoing maintenance. Once set up, your customers will have immediate access to integrations with **Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks** (let us know what we should add next!). They’ll be able to map their data to your expected data model and choose the syncing frequency so the data is never out of date. ### **Our ask:** If you need access to your customer’s data warehouse, book some time with us [here](https://calendly.com/cole-cable/cole-15-min) or check out our [website](https://www.fabra.io/).

coil - cut fees & kill churn with seamless bank payments 🚫💳,"### TL;DR: Credit card processing fees are outrageous, and credit card declines account for nearly half of all subscription churn — we're solving these problems once and for all. coil allows you to seamlessly accept bank payments from customers with a simple experience they'll actually use — no account, routing, or microdeposits needed. # The Problems ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/82730/36640ff2-f625-49d1-93b1-b7fc00187466) ### 📉 Delinquent Churn If you rely on credit cards for your subscription payments, you’re probably familiar with churn from credit card declines. Recurring credit card charges are declined [15% of the time](https://www.chargebee.com/blog/making-sense-credit-card-declines/#:\\~:text=According%20to%20Visa%20and%20Mastercard,card%20machines%20of%20the%20web.) and account for [48% of churn](https://www.pymnts.com/subscriptions/2021/almost-half-of-subscription-churn-caused-by-preventable-friction-in-failed-payments/), making them the single largest source of churn for most subscription businesses. ### 💸 Processing Fees American businesses spent over [$138B on credit card processing fees](https://nilsonreport.com/mention/1586/1link/) last year, which is only growing. With Visa and Mastercard controlling more than 70% of the market, they have no incentive to reduce these fees themselves. This is especially painful for businesses that sell high-ticket items or operate on low margins, where every single percentage point can move the needle. # Our Solution ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/82730/6478a091-1af2-4a1c-b14f-1660f235b380) coil tackles both of these problems by getting to the root of the issue: credit cards. We’re building a new, seamless experience to help you collect payments via bank transfer (ACH/RTP) instead of credit cards and handling all of the complexity behind the scenes. Our first product is a “Pay with coil” button that can be added directly to your pre-existing checkout flow for one-off or subscription payments. When a customer uses coil for the very first time, they’ll securely link their bank through Plaid. Afterward, they can verify their identity through an SMS or Email verification code, allowing authenticated payments in seconds. You can checkout the returning flow here: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/82730/f090bdc8-de04-437a-a8a6-daf8abc36a06) This is already a huge improvement over today’s ACH experience, and we’re just getting started. Over the coming months and years, we’ll continue to flesh out the scenarios and integrations necessary to become the default payment method for a post-credit card world. # Asks * Reach out if you're looking to reduce your processing fees or eradicate churn from credit card declines — all YC companies will receive priority onboarding. * Share with anyone you think might be interested in moving past cards to reduce fees & churn.

Buildt: LLM powered codebase search and multi-file code generation,"**TLDR: Buildt is an AI tool to help developers quickly search and understand large codebases. Engineers at companies like Stripe and Airbnb have to work with million-line codebases; our LLM-powered tool makes this simple** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69561&key=user_uploads/797223/8df5da76-60d4-4de1-901a-3f6ded7a5e43) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69561&key=user_uploads/797223/ac271cfe-9484-4cb3-8907-c80c43de21f5) **❌ The Problem** Current solutions to search codebases are limited to keyword matches and lack the ability to take into account the context of an entire project. This slows down and frustrates every developer as it’s impossible to remember where every snippet of code is and how a function works.  Even when you search for the right keyword, the results are incomplete as there are many frequent searches that can’t be captured by a single keyword or require deep contextual understanding  **e.g. “where are authentication tokens stored?”**  Even when developers do find the code snippet they had in mind they may also be stuck in understanding how it works. They then have to do more digging or ask a colleague, slowing down productivity. **✨ Our Solution** Install our VS Code extension and immediately you can start asking plain English, broad or nuanced questions about your codebase. It’s like having a colleague with perfect memory and understanding of your codebase sitting next to you.  _Example queries:_  **_‘Show me the user hook’_** **_‘Find where we initialize Stripe in React and add some logging’_** **_‘Do we use Mixpanel Analytics? If so, where and why?’_** **_‘How does authentication work on the backend?’_** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69561&key=user_uploads/797223/f3327c35-5519-4711-91ff-624f8ff9cac1) **⚙️ How it works** Buildt combines large language models with embeddings to gain a better than human and contextual understanding of your codebase that you can then query with natural language. We index/map your entire codebase by using our own fine tuned LLM which we’ve trained with proprietary synthetic data. As a result, our tool instantly understands what code snippets do rather than what simply it is. And because we’re project wide, the tool understands the relationship between lines of code across different files.  All of this means you can ask questions about your codebase conversationally, as if you were asking a friend for help when you’re stuck.   **🚀 What’s next?**  With full contextual understanding of the entire project we can successfully perform super accurate cross-file codegen from a natural language input e.g.  **_‘Add firebase analytics to every user interaction’_** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69561&key=user_uploads/797223/f40c9f99-388c-4bdb-a3a3-840acab7d0ae) **🙏 Asks** Try Buildt and start searching!

Onu - Turn scripts into internal tools without doing any frontend work,"**tl;dr:** Onu is a developer-first tool that allows engineers to turn the repetitive scripts and workflows they're asked to run for their ops or CX teammates into production-ready internal tools. Onu doesn’t require any frontend work at all, so developers can spend their time writing business critical code instead of building or dragging/dropping frontend components. Sign up for our [waitlist](https://joinonu.com/?utm_source=yclaunch) for early access!   Hi everyone! We’re Lindsey and Chine, and we’re excited to announce [Onu](https://joinonu.com/?utm_source=yclaunch)!  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69549&key=user_uploads/838199/d4e8ff75-31ac-445a-ac37-c428f4f503a0) Chine and Lindsey are both software engineers who met 5 years ago when they started working at Lyft.  [Chine](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chineikoro/) worked as an engineer at Bain before working at Lyft on the bikes & scooters team. After Lyft, Chine went to Stripe where she worked on banking-as-a-service, corporate cards, and payment links. [Lindsey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-redd/) worked on developer infrastructure and observability at Lyft before leaving to work at Stripe where she worked on low-code/no-code payments on the checkout and payment links teams.  ## 😢 **Problem** * **Tasks that involve both engineering and ops/CX are disjointed and time consuming.** Engineers spend too much time writing and running one-off scripts (e.g. fixing an out-of-sync user account) and ops/CX are often blocked by engineering. * **Building internal tools (even with low-code/no-code saas) takes a lot of frontend work.** As a result, building the tool stays in the backlog and engineers & ops keep schlepping through tasks. ## **🥳 Our solution** Onu is a developer-first tool that allows engineers to quickly turn their ops/CX-related scripts or workflows into production-ready internal tools without having to write any frontend code at all. * **Spin up internal tools quickly** using the scripts you’ve already written, spending **zero time on frontend development.** * **See logs of each task’s previous executions** to keep track of when it was run, who ran it, and the result * Run scripts in your own environment but **without having to SSH into production** * **Use built-in integrations** to easily add actions to your tasks like posting to Slack, sending an email, or generating a Linear issue **🤯 You can use Onu to…** * **Onboard** **new users** to your product and then send them a welcome **email**  * **Cancel a subscription**, refund the customer, and then update your **CRM** * **Fix an out-of-sync user account** and then notify a **Slack** channel of the fix ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69549&key=user_uploads/838199/3c3d3105-f01e-46a2-b5ea-b38d019b23c9) ## **🌱 Why we built Onu** We experienced these problems firsthand while working on fast moving engineering teams at Lyft and Stripe. Our teams needed internal tooling, but we didn’t have time to build feature-rich admin dashboards. Stripe had a homegrown tool that allowed engineers to spin up internal tools without writing frontend code. When we started working on Onu with a different idea we immediately felt the pain of not having a similar tool.  ## **🙌🏾 Asks** * **Sign up** - Join our [waitlist](https://joinonu.com/?utm_source=yclaunch) for early access!

⚛️ Lavo Life Sciences - Computer simulations of drug molecules,"### **TL;DR** Lavo Life Sciences runs simulations of drug molecules on computers. Pharma companies use our simulations to guide their experiments, saving hundreds of millions of dollars and years of time in the lab. This will de-risk clinical trials and expedite FDA approval. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69547&key=user_uploads/148651/80bc9d1a-e8b4-41cc-8ca1-5deed312ecbc) This is what a pill looks like at the molecular level. Drug molecules pack into repeating patterns–or “crystal structures”–which control the drug’s stability. This particular drug (Ritonavir) was recalled when the developers chose an unstable crystal structure. This recall could have been avoided with effective simulation. ### **🤔 The Problem** Lavo’s simulation software predicts the crystal structure of drug molecules. The crystal structure refers to the three-dimensional pattern in which individual molecules pack to form a solid. Choosing the best crystal structure before clinical trials maximizes the efficacy, shelf-stability, and safety of the drug. Failure to accurately determine the crystal structure can lead to problems in manufacturing, legal protection of the drug patent, and success in clinical trials. From conversations with pharma companies, we’ve learned that they want more of these predictions, but existing vendors are too slow and expensive–think hundreds of thousands of computer hours for a single molecule. This is a limitation of their methodology and is also our key differentiator. This market is large and growing. 15,000 relevant drugs enter R&D each year, and pharma companies spend over $100M on crystal structure predictions annually. Also, we have learned that pharma companies need predictions on larger drugs than are currently possible with today's methods, so we have an opportunity to expand the market with more efficient products. ### **🔨 Why now, why us?** We are uniquely positioned to solve this problem – Zach and Derek have PhDs in computational chemistry and Scott is a former Google Cloud PM. We are prepared to tackle this scientific challenge at an industrial scale. ### **💡 Our Solution** We started working on this problem 4 months ago and our simulations are already 10x faster than current methods We use AI and quantum chemistry algorithms to improve every step of the crystal structure prediction workflow: * We use custom algorithms to quickly get an understanding of the landscape of possible crystals. * We use AI to accurately rank crystal structures 100x faster than traditional techniques * We scale our software on the cloud to achieve rapid turnaround times. ### **❤️ Our Asks** We are interested in meeting people in the pharma industry.

Bluebirds - Resell to past customers who switched jobs,"### **TL;DR** * **What:** Bluebirds helps outbound teams resell to past customers who have switched jobs. Past customers are **4x more likely to convert to Closed / Won deals** with **much faster sales cycles.** It’s low hanging fruit and flies under the radar because of stale CRM data and workflow limitations. * **How:** Any sales rep, manager, or rev ops can sign up on [www.bluebirds.ai](http://www.bluebirds.ai) and Bluebirds will automatically identify champions using Machine Learning, detect job changes, and deliver hundreds of warm leads ranked by your ICP. * **Traction:** Revenue teams at scale-ups like Front, OneSignal, and a dozen more use Bluebirds to track their customer job changes and maximize outbound efficiency. * **Ask: Sign up, or refer any sales teams, and we’ll deliver 100 free warm leads.** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/987806/859fa27a-5373-4527-8d37-2fe95c918ec1) ### **Problem and why existing solutions don’t work** Outbound sales isn’t working like it used to. **Conversions rates have tanked** because every sales team is using the same tech stack to spam buyer inboxes, and sales leaders are under pressure from their CEOs and Boards to grow efficiently. But most of the **outbound sales process is not efficient at all.** Luckily there’s one sales play that works exceptionally well – reselling to your past customers who already trust your company and switched jobs. These leads, AKA _“blue birds”_, are your sales teams’ favorite. They’re layups, but also painfully difficult to track at scale. **Existing solutions like LinkedIn Sales Navigator aren’t deeply connected to your CRM**. They don’t know who your customers are or what your ICP is, and rely on **manual / brittle filters** **that break** once you have over \\~100 customers. The result is that most of your reps just aren’t tracking customer job changes. Yet 10% to 20% of your CRM contacts have already switched jobs, and 1 to 2% switch every month. This 👏 Is 👏 ARR 👏 Left 👏 On 👏 The 👏 Table 👏 ### **How Bluebirds works** What used to take reps hours to hack in Sales Navigator now happens automatically with 2 clicks and runs continuously in the background. Oh, and it’s free to get started. Here’s how: * **Sign Up:** Anyone (Founders, VPs, Managers, AEs, SDRs, Sales Ops, etc.) can [sign up on our website](http://bluebirds.ai/) and log in via SFDC secure authentication. * **Find Champions:** Our algorithms will find which contacts in your CRM are likely to buy your product again. * **Match Identities:** We’ll match your sparse contacts to public identities (i.e. john@hotmail is John Smith at Airtable) and check if they’ve switched jobs. * **Deliver Leads:** Finally we’ll rank all the leads based on similarity to your ICP and send them to you, along with monthly updates with any fresh job changes. ### **Why us** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/987806/ab789d18-71a3-4cc5-a5bf-38e4cea98af4) [Kunal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kpunera/) and [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohanpunamia/) are well-versed with contact data and building AI systems to solve sales problems.

An international ramp can be as expensive as 10% per transaction, thanks to lack of liquidity, payment processor fees, and exchange rates. **This made using crypto infrastructure really difficult, until now!** # **Koywe Infrastructure** Koywe provides simple, well-documented, and fully compliant payment APIs (both GrapQL and REST) and SDKs so that any developer can instantly start leveraging crypto to offer services like remittances, USD wallets, and investments, at **the best local prices and fully compliant in each country**. As easy as 1, 2, 3. For example, get a real quote to sell 1,000 USDC on Polygon and receive CLP: ``` curl --location --request POST 'https://api.koywe.com/rest/quotes' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --data-raw '{     \""amountIn\"": 1000,     \""symbolIn\"": \""USDC Polygon\"",     \""symbolOut\"": \""CLP\"",     \""executable\"": false }' ``` **Try it out now!** **Pro Tip**: Changing _executable_ to _true_ allows you to execute that quote within 10 seconds of creating it. ### **We make it as easy as possible.** We wrote our docs to be **very easy** to read and understand. They get updated almost every week with feedback from our dear customers. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kz4B52QeqIh3WpxYN9jtPFYy-vJB4kxVx3ZiIiTTO3yPDThyHikT4B-lHzzSRAg6gZWrkDFobDosHUWEempKtcmIY3X2mQJ4SOkTaekFP6sBm2Y7iJeCdmL1vHAy7g6CqTyEvwzJ9Tsz5m8e1QMTawo) And if APIs or SDKs are too complicated for you _(or can't be bothered with yet another integration)_, we can spin up a completely customized web view or url just for you! **In under an hour we had set up a bespoke solution for one of our DeFi customers!** ### **The Future** We have a **long-term vision of crypto enabling even more complex use cases**, like lending, invoice discounting, and other financial services that help speed up the region's development.

Clad - Software to manage telecom subcontractors,"> _tl;dr:_ [_Clad_](https://www.withclad.com?utm_source=launch_yc&utm_medium=link_in_post&utm_campaign=022223_launchyc) _is a subcontractor management platform. We help telecom companies construct their networks faster, cheaper, and with fewer costly issues. Clad does this by streamlining everything from bidding through payments, all in one system._  > _Know anyone who works at a telco or data center?_ [_Reach out_](mailto:jason@withclad.com)_!_ ### The Problem Demand for high speed internet is accelerating, driven by the rise of remote work alongside new public and private investment. As a result, ISPs, data centers, and other operators are rapidly expanding their networks.  Telcos rely on contractors to get this construction done. And with the rapid growth in deployments, there’s more need for them than ever before. As a result, telcos are struggling to find and retain enough high quality contractors, putting budgets and timelines at risk. It’s no surprise telcos are having a tough time - the way they work with their subcontractors is broken at every step of construction: ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T6CNj3VYdBdETF7lwV9IKA95DtBujw8pMwGmLEi3qpbrgmZidTyIJwn-NEh1WiEjORDd6hCEmT7L6cKdGhuDOjE7EcBcb_WOQciZj0f9Fwbc2j6Y-8Abh8TomWsj7ScYzKpt7qyqKi8BZbo_Va3cByQ) ### Enter: Clad Clad is a subcontractor management platform tailor-made for telecom construction. We streamline how telecom companies bid out and qualify subcontractors, track construction progress, and create, approve, and pay invoices too. Our entire goal is to eliminate the time consuming back-office functions that come from working with subcontractors.  Curious how? Take a look 👇 With Clad, telcos get out of email and spreadsheets - speeding projects up, saving money, and getting the insights to improve construction over time: ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZFyNTkN1ZWfSZ60KsUFm_ibKme0xQLMg600PJ1dR0nF3_sjSrhFZQyCw6jHCP6QOJX85VotA6K2sbE0u-mN6-FlJt-XlcrXmYAiOGXnmP34rvHK8nIoThCUeV6UumCuj3Rh0iGlg-Y4xq-CgTz_Yj7U) _I’m_ [_Jason_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonrudin/)_, and I started Clad because growing up, I saw first-hand how time consuming and painful it can be to work with subcontractors. When I was younger, my mom worked at a telco. I’d regularly hear stories about projects that were delayed or over budget because of miscommunications or errors with contractors. Last year I met two friends in telco who were complaining about the same problems as my mom. Hearing that, I dug in to learn more, and was shocked to learn that not much had changed in the decades since then. I’m building Clad to change this status quo._ _I’m excited to build Clad because today, it remains too hard to build new things. And with high quality effective tools, we can get more done, faster._ ### You can help! 1. **Share this post** - you never know who knows someone in telecom 2. **Connect** Clad to General Contractors, ISPs, data centers, or anyone else in telecom construction at [jason@withclad.com](mailto:jason@withclad.com) _Thanks!_",Jason Rudin,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c7adb75cd4b5f53965e972f582139018100f49ff.jpg,,28070

👓 SpecCheck - Unifying how the optical industry does business,"**_Tl;dr:_** _SpecCheck is an all-in-one solution that provides accurate prescription eyewear ordering and tracking, seamless billing, and streamlined communication between patients, eye doctors, and their lab partners. SpecCheck’s users work more efficiently and make fewer costly errors, increasing productivity and improving their overall workflow._ Hello, World! We’re Joe DeMaria and Arnold Villatoro, the co-founders of [SpecCheck](http://www.speccheckrx.com). Together with our team of industry experts and seasoned software engineers, we’re on a mission to revolutionize the optical industry. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69528&key=user_uploads/1251063/d58a9c75-3474-4b78-a5af-978c0f8eea1c) _Co-founders Joe DeMaria and Arnold Villatoro_ ### **❌ The Problem: Current optical industry software sucks!** Did you know it takes a coordinated team of eye doctors, opticians, technicians, and an optical lab to successfully dispense a _single pair_ of prescription eyeglasses? Despite this complex balancing act, each of these groups are forced to use antiquated technology and systems built in the 1990s that are fragmented, outdated, and limited to specific use cases. This results in glasses taking longer than they should to reach the patient, and results in expensive remakes. Not-so-fun fact: one in ten pairs of glasses needs to be redone before they are ready for pick up. ### 😎 **The Solution: SpecCheck** SpecCheck is a unified ordering, billing, and communications platform designed specifically for the optical industry. Our solution centralizes all processes involved in the purchasing and manufacturing of prescription eyewear, saving time and reducing costly errors. Some of our features include:  * **✨ Modern Dashboard:** Our simple and intuitive dashboard appeals to both new and veteran eye doctors. * **👓 Order Entry:** The easiest way for eye doctors to electronically transmit eyewear orders to optical laboratories, with advanced data validations to reduce errors. * **💳 Payments Processing:** Doctors can conveniently pay lab invoices directly from our platform. * **💬 Customer Service Live Chat:** Communicate more efficiently with optical labs to check order statuses, make edits, and request additional information. * **🔔 Patient Notifications & Tracking:** Keep patients in the know with one-click order notifications and our self-service patient order tracker. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69528&key=user_uploads/1251063/7a550fda-8c41-49eb-8cf3-c4478ff946f1) _SpecCheck’s Dashboard_ ### **⭐ Why Us?** [Joe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joe-demaria-15a15943/) began his career in the optical industry in 2012, working as an optician for several different offices. In 2016 he was recruited to work for a key industry player, Shamir Insight, and afterwards for Johnson & Johnson Vision as a sales executive. As he traversed the industry in various roles, Joe realized that thousands of other eye doctors and optical labs were suffering from the same problems and frustrations he had encountered during his career.  When Joe approached his friend [Arnold](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnold-villatoro-85629330/) about creating a new technology resource to unify the fragmented optical industry, Arnold was quick to see the vision (pun intended). Arnold’s career started at Workday building the infrastructure for an internal job scheduler. Most recently, Arnold was the lead staff engineer for the payments infrastructure and processing teams at Lyft. With his diverse experience designing scalable and easy-to-use technology solutions for millions of users, Joe and Arnold make the perfect co-founding team. ### 🙏 **Our Asks** * **📣 Sharing:** Share this post with your network, and follow us on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/speccheck)! * **➡️ Referrals:** Connect us with any family, friends, or colleagues who work in the optical industry.  * **🖥️ Product Demos:** If you’re in the industry and would like to learn more about [SpecCheck](https://www.speccheckrx.com/), please [contact us today](https://www.speccheckrx.com/contact). * **🚀 Investors:** Please reach out to us at [investors@speccheckrx.com](mailto:investors@speccheckrx.com) to discuss investment opportunities.  ",Arnold Villatoro,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/10a0849cc24195da8084cda03e06dc2462c0b923.jpg,Otherimage_28413_1.jpg;Otherimage_28413_2.jpg;,28413
⚡ Chart - Lightning-fast inference servers in your cloud,"**TL;DR:** Chart transforms ML models into CUDA/HIP optimized C++ code for lightning-fast inference. Users simply integrate their cloud provider and we deploy fast, auto-scaling inference servers in their own cloud account, abstracting away all the complexities of MLOps. Hi YC community, I am Fatih, founder of [Chart](https://www.getcharteditor.com). ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/742211/c0ac3edd-f06e-4687-8132-7b393a799736) ### **🧐 The Problem** It’s hard to deploy ML models into production. Building production-grade inference APIs from trained models remains a challenge. On top of that, many popular models take a long time to serve even a single request, making the user experience frustratingly slow. Most teams want to improve their products with AI features but expect the same low latency requirements they are accustomed to. In addition, some companies with sensitive data can only use solutions within their VPC, having to deal with the complexities of MLOps in-house. ### **⚒️ Our Solution** We solve this problem by making it super easy for companies to self-host high-performant ML models. The model and the data stay within the companies’ cloud provider (AWS or GCP), but we offer a SaaS platform to hide all the complexities of packaging models (Dockerfiles, Flask servers, CUDA versions, etc.), provisioning right-sized GPU servers and deploying them into well-documented APIs. All within the user’s own cloud account, in the same region as the rest of their servers, and optimized to squeeze the full performance of the GPU. For reference, on an NVIDIA A100 GPU 40B, we achieved 56.57 it/s for a single 512×512 text2image generation for Stable Diffusion 2.0. The benchmark for a Pytorch model is [3.74](https://lambdalabs.com/blog/inference-benchmark-stable-diffusion) seconds for 50 steps compared to sub-second with Chart: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/742211/e8b16947-6c07-4c0d-8a22-c097d39c9f35) ### **⚙️ How Chart works** Users integrate their cloud accounts through IAM roles with the right permissions set. They choose from a catalog of open-source models or upload their proprietary models and simply click Deploy.  After that, Chart first compiles the model into CUDA/HIP optimized C++ code, packages the model with an HTTP server into a Docker image, and provisions an auto-scaling Kubeflow cluster with an optimized configuration file to minimize the GPU compute costs.  In the end, users have a dedicated high-performant inference API in their VPC, UI to interact with the API, and a Grafana dashboard for monitoring. ### **🙏 Our asks** * Are you a company that wants to add AI features but is worried about performance, scalability, or data privacy? Send an email to [fatih@getcharteditor.com](mailto:fatih@getcharteditor.com) or book a [demo](https://calendly.com/fatihcelikbas/15min). * Intros to companies who are struggling with ML deployment for any reason or don’t have the engineering resources to deploy and maintain their models. * Share feedback!

🤖 🌮 OfOne - Automating order taking at fast food drive-thrus,"**TL;DR:** OfOne is building software to automate order taking at fast-food drive-thrus. Using LLMs, we can save the typical restaurant owner $60,000 in labor costs per store annually. Hi YC community - Adam Proschek (right) and Will Edwards (center) here - founders of [OfOne](https://www.of.one/).  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69517&key=user_uploads/1162985/20300ff2-47c3-4229-83f1-f4987fe5ffd1) ### **The Problem:** Quick-service restaurants are a $300B industry in the United States, comprising roughly 300,000 individual restaurant units. These businesses are low-margin with food & labor costs making up \\~70% of OPEX. In recent years, operators (many of whom are immigrants and small business owners) have been getting squeezed as inflation and wages rise and labor becomes more scarce. ### **The Solution:** OfOne is helping fast food operators make more money by automating their largest ordering channel: the drive-thru. There are 200,000 drive-thrus in the United States and in many cases they contribute 70%+ of order volume. They are also expensive, costing on average $14.00 per hour to staff and operating for 12 hours per day - representing $12B in aggregate labor costs. We’re offsetting these labor costs by automating the end-to-end ordering process - from greeting customers to answering questions to processing orders through the point-of-sale. Plus, it works with existing drive-thru audio systems. Additionally, OfOne can intelligently upsell - like suggesting ice cream on a hot day - and always says please and thank you, raising average order size and improving customer experience. We currently have signed & deployed pilots at major national chain stores. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69517&key=user_uploads/1162985/7d2fbb4f-dcc7-456f-b7d4-d5dcd518392a) ### **Why we’re building OfOne:** We both know the quick-service industry well from building Crew (acq. by Square in 2021), which sold employee communication software to QSR brands, like Taco Bell. Through this experience, we built valuable industry relationships and more importantly gained an in-depth understanding of how critical controlling labor costs is for restaurant success. Frankly, it can be the difference between a growing business and defaulting on interest payments for a personally guaranteed loan. ### **Our Ask:** If you have any connections with **franchisees**, **multi-unit restaurant operators**, or **leaders at corporate brands** (e.g., Taco Bell Corporate), we’d love to speak with them and share how we can help! _Here’s a quick blurb you can copy and paste_: A team of restaurant tech entrepreneurs recently launched an AI-powered order taker for quick-service restaurant drive-thrus. They are helping operators boost margins by reducing labor costs and increasing order sizes. You can contact [will@of.one](mailto:will@of.one) for more information. If easier, I can also craft an easily forwardable email for you. Just reach out and let me know 😊.",Will Edwards,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c011c52895d609a4070290409b96ecdd4fd828ef.jpg,Otherimage_27815_1.jpg;Otherimage_27815_2.jpg;,27815
TorMagnus - Finding better treatments for Parkinson’s disease,"Hi YC! This is [Talia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/talia-krainc-226296201/) and [John](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-fraser-271159182/) from TorMagnus. **WHO WE ARE** At TorMagnus, we’re finding the converging pathways and proteins involved in disease, starting with Parkinson’s disease. We do so by leveraging the scientific and computational approaches behind network medicine. We are collaborating with a renowned Parkinson's lab to validate our findings. Our therapeutic foothold is Parkinson’s disease, but our platform is applicable to a wide range of other diseases.  TorMagnus is named after Talia’s best friend. Tor, and patients like him who suffer from devastating diseases, serve as our inspiration to contribute to therapeutic innovation. **THE SCIENCE** Network medicine is a multidisciplinary approach that aims to understand and treat diseases by analyzing the complex interactions between biological systems and networks, rather than by focusing solely on individual genes, proteins, or cells.  One key aspect of network medicine is the identification of drug targets, which are molecules or cellular components that can be modulated by drugs to treat or prevent a disease. Traditional drug discovery approaches often target single molecules or pathways, which can be limited in their efficacy and can lead to unwanted side effects. In contrast, network medicine approaches consider the entire biological system and its interconnected networks, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanisms. By analyzing the molecular interactions and pathways involved in a disease, network medicine can identify key nodes or hubs in the network that are critical for disease development and progression. These nodes may be targeted with drugs to disrupt the network and halt or reverse the disease process.  We are harnessing the power of network medicine to identify novel drug targets by revealing the interconnectedness of different biological pathways and identifying nodes that have not been previously targeted. **WE’D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU** If you’re interested in learning more about TorMagnus, please feel free to reach out!",Talia Krainc,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/49933a997e76a8ca44e917155a1daee9e8d34c48.jpg,,27826

Mercoa: The accounts payable & BillPay API for B2B fintechs,"Hi everyone! We’re Sai and Sandeep and we’re building Mercoa. ### TL;DR [Mercoa](https://mercoa.com) lets any B2B fintech offer BillPay and Accounts Payable services to their customers. Use our drop-in iframe or API to offer your users one place to manage and pay all of their invoices. ### The Problem: B2B fintechs want to be the one-stop-shop for their customers to manage their business finances. Customers want to manage their open bills & invoices on the same platform where they are receiving payments. Helping customers get paid is usually one of the first things a B2B fintech builds. Customers are willing to pay a payment processing fee, so monetizing incoming payments is seen as an easy win. On the other hand, helping customers make invoice and bill payments is not as simple. Aside from building the complex software needed to manage and process these payments, most fintechs do not see a clear way to monetize payments out. ### Monetizing Payments Out: The best way to make money from B2B BillPay is to offer premium payment options that help customers maintain their cash flow while ensuring their vendors are paid on time. These options include: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69478&key=user_uploads/6155/329aba45-12ca-4c42-90d4-7227c80aa20e) Before a business can offer these options to their customers, they first need to build a software experience that lets their customers pay their bills & invoices with confidence. This experience consists of eight different components that must be tightly integrated together: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69478&key=user_uploads/6155/b5468918-1141-42c3-9ef2-8f4feeb4d11a) Most companies piece together a solution with some but not all of these components in an effort to launch as quickly as possible. They find themselves in an endless cycle of optimizing an experience with no meaningful end in sight to start monetizing. Some companies we spoke with spent three years optimizing their BillPay experience. Others ended up abandoning their BillPay efforts. ### Our Solution: A white-labeled, embedded BillPay experience with pre-built payment monetization With Mercoa, offering BillPay and Accounts Payable services to your users is as simple as dropping our iframe into your product. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69478&key=user_uploads/6155/07acf804-a804-4e6b-821d-66349d464ab3) Using our drop-in iframe or API, you can offer your users one place to: * Manage open invoices & bills * Schedule payments * Invite vendors to choose how they want to receive their payment When you offer AP using Mercoa, your users can: * Pay any invoice by credit card * Pay any invoice by ACH * Pay any invoice with BNPL And your user’s vendor can: * Receive their payment via check * Receive their payment via ACH * Receive their payment via Virtual Card The best part is whenever a user or a vendor chooses a premium payment option, Mercoa shares revenue generated with you. Our payments-focused BillPay experience decouples a bill payment transaction; allowing payers to pay how they want and letting vendors choose how they want to receive their payment. Our goal is to be a payments orchestration engine that can power any BillPay or Accounts Payable process. ### BillPay is so boring! Why are we working on this? In a previous life, Sai was a payments lead at [Bill.com](http://Bill.com). There, he integrated [Bill.com](http://Bill.com) with a neobank and led the Instant Transfer line of business. Both of these experiences exposed him to the challenges B2B neobanks face in offering BillPay to their customers. Sai realized that [Bill.com](http://Bill.com)’s systems were completely unoptimized for an embedded use case which is becoming more common with the rise of B2B vertical SaaS and fintech platforms. We believe we’re still in the very early innings of digital B2B BillPay and see a massive opportunity to digitize the $25 trillion in annual business payments in the US and eventually the globe! ### Our Ask: * Want to offer Accounts Payable services to your customers? Book a [demo](https://calendly.com/sai-mercoa/insider-s-guide-chat-clone?back=1&month=2023-02) or email Sai at [sai@mercoa.com](mailto:sai@mercoa.com) * Know a company who is looking to offer Accounts Payable services to their customers?

Questa – Just ask your data warehouse!,"Hey everyone! We’re James, Tony, and Tejas from Questa. **TL;DR** Questa is an assistant for the enterprise data warehouse. Our platform makes it easy for business teams to query, visualize, and take action on their data without SQL. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/730164/e8d9e833-77f6-4af2-ae37-420f83e7c95d) **The problem** Companies are consolidating their data in warehouses, and want every business function to be data-savvy. But most business stakeholders aren’t fluent with SQL. This leads to two challenges: 1. Business teams are bottlenecked on getting the answers they need, sometimes waiting days for a query or report. 2. Analytics teams spend too much time fielding data requests from across the company. Responding to each request is highly manual, and there isn’t an easy way to share context behind key business metrics. **Our solution** Questa is a natural language interface to the data warehouse. Users can ask questions like “_how many customers did we bring on in each industry segment last month”_ or “_remind me when I have more than 30 support tickets outstanding”_ and get a curated answer, visualization, or workflow. Questa learns the context behind how business metrics like churn are defined by integrating with key data assets. How does this help? Business teams now have an easy and self-serve way of getting data answers. Every customer call, ops alert, prospect outreach and product decision can now be made with full data context. Data teams free up hours of bandwidth every week to focus on high impact projects that drive the business forward. **Our story** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69455&key=user_uploads/730164/50625a0e-d038-4b7e-953f-f643ba95b8ce) We’ve been longtime friends since college and grad school. We came together to build a company around our shared passion for democratizing data and analytics. Before working on Questa, James did a PhD at Stanford on data systems, Tony did a PhD at Stanford in machine learning, and Tejas worked on ML-driven products as an engineer and PM at Google Research.\\ \\ **Our ask: please try it out!** Questa integrates natively with your data warehouse, like any other BI tool or warehouse app – no data prep required! Please see our [sandbox](https://www.questadata.com), and try out natural language queries on a sample dataset.

"🐦 Pigeon - Document collection made easy, organized and secure","**💥TL;DR** We’re building DocuSign for document collection where clients can upload documents into a secure, interactive checklist without creating an account. 👋 Hi everyone, we're [Adam B](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bulow/), [Rohin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhargavarohin/) and [Adam S](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsharf/) – and we’re really excited to launch [Pigeon](https://www.pigeondocuments.com/)! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69451&key=user_uploads/1160664/ead9b300-2a20-4bdd-a5de-86127254f172) _from left to right:_\\ [Adam S](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamsharf/) -  COO | ex-Harvard Law School\\ [Adam B](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bulow/) - CEO | ex-Google Data Scientist\\ [Rohin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhargavarohin/) - CTO | ex-Microsoft Software Engineer **😩 The Problem:** Businesses need to collect documents from clients, but the process is often disorganized, time-consuming and insecure. To collect documents securely businesses have to either 1) set up clunky client portals with accounts for each of their clients, or 2) create Dropbox/Box folders for each request and email their clients links to an empty folder with a list of what to upload. Both of these methods are a pain for clients, inefficient for the firm, and a nightmare to keep track of. Firms also have to send out burdensome follow up emails to remind clients to upload their documents, and sift through poorly named and unorganized files to make sense of what their clients sent them. **🥳 Our Solution** [Pigeon](https://www.pigeondocuments.com/) is a web platform where you can send itemized request checklists to your clients’ emails so they know exactly which documents you need, clients can securely upload documents into the checklist without needing an account, and you can track and manage all of your requests in an organized dashboard. Pigeon will also send automatic reminder emails to your clients to make sure they submit their documents on time. **🧐 Take a look**  1.

🌳 PoplarML – Deploy machine learning models with one command,"👋 Hey Everyone, this is Danna and Evan, and we’re super excited to introduce PoplarML! ### 📖 **TL;DR** Building deployment infrastructure for machine learning models is difficult and time-consuming. With PoplarML, you can replace that process with one simple command. We handle all of the infrastructure to deploy and serve at scale, enabling you to focus on building your product. ### ❌ **The Problem** AI-powered products have grown in popularity but many are deterred by the challenges to bring their models to life. Deploying a machine learning model to production is complex and requires a heavy engineering lift. Building the infrastructure to support ML models takes days, increasing the time to ship your product.  ## ⚡ **The Solution** PoplarML helps teams easily deploy custom machine-learning models to production. With one simple CLI command, you can turn your model into an API endpoint that you can integrate with the rest of your product. Our endpoints come with auto-scaling out of the box, ensuring low-latency when there are bursts of requests to your model. PoplarML can deploy any custom model, regardless of the framework used. Some examples of models that our customers have deployed on PoplarML are:  * Flan-T5-XXL * Whisper * Stable-Diffusion-2 ### 🤖 **How it Works** 1. ✏️ Define a Load and Predict function in a [main.py](http://main.py) file 2. 💻 Use our CLI tool to pick a GPU instance and deploy your model 3. 🚀 Use the returned API endpoint in your product ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69447&key=user_uploads/522488/30758efd-4ce3-48d0-94be-e43093ad027f) ### 💡 **Why PoplarML was Built** We have personally felt the pain of deploying models to production and have previously built ML deployment infrastructure at companies such as Amazon and Snapchat. With PoplarML, we would like to provide a better and more streamlined experience for ML development.  ### **🙌 Our Asks** * Reach out via our [contact us](https://poplarml.com/contact.html) form or book a time directly on our [calendly](https://calendly.com/poplarml/15min) if you want to try PoplarML * Share this with anyone you know building AI-powered products or companies * Upvote and share this post!",Danna Liu,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/f8031b2bc79dd8cb941d56543eeafeb8ed6f8cc6.jpg,Otherimage_27821_1.jpg;,27821
JustPaid.io (Loopfour) - Spend confidently with smart financial tools,"### TL;DR [JustPaid.io](http://JustPaid.io) is the AI-powered controller you wish you had earlier, so you will never have to worry about overpaying bills again. ### Problem Companies' current financial processes are disconnected from what you _agreed_ to pay vs. what you were _actually_ charged, even when your vendor makes a billing error. This is what we’re here to resolve. On average, United States businesses lose over $300,000 per year alone from invoice fraud totaling $12B. Don’t be a statistic.  With expanding teams, a lot of vendor workflows are stuck in Slack and inboxes.  We are automating workflows to successfully manage vendors, including contracts, projected spend, W9/W8BEn collection, payment approval and remittance.  ### Solution Saving thousands of dollars in real-time overview of your usage and billing, [JustPaid.io](http://JustPaid.io) provides a centralized experience to automate and manage vendor relationships, overspending, and more to ensure no matter the stage of your organization, you are always in control. We collect data from your contracts all in one dashboard and compare it to both your historical as well as ongoing spend. We work with your existing bill payment solution or you can leverage our multi-approval workflow. ### Backstory Our backstory is founded on personal experience that is often shared by many in the YC Community: “_My firm and I were handling all the bookkeeping, accounting and controller functions for over 1,000 startups in the past 10 years. It’s the same issues with the lack of workflow. There is always the same persistent disconnect of management and finance teams. Endless emails between so many stakeholders due to the contract negotiation process with no meaningful control when the bill is due. Additionally, collecting W9/W8BEN forms, and setting up payment accounts.”_  _- Anelya Grant // Co-CEO_ [_JustPaid.io_](http://JustPaid.io) _(Loopfour)_ _“As a second-time founder, I know it can be a burden to keep a daily eye on spend, yet it is a necessary part of running a successful startup looking into what is owed and what is paid. I wanted to create a tool I wish I had that gave real-time financial insights. Founders and their teams need a copilot providing a usable dashboard to make them certain about cash flow visibility into their company, giving financial insights real-time.”_ _- Daniel Kivatinos // Co-CEO_ [_JustPaid.io_](http://JustPaid.io) _(Loopfour)_ _“I want every founder out there to have accurate financial information at their fingertips so that every employee can feel secure.”_ _- Vinay Pinnaka // Co-Founder and Founding Engineer_ [_JustPaid.io_](http://JustPaid.io) _(Loopfour)_ ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aaAXDhjlpZgFRCKiGdU36ksQkCeDyTb-2lNZJYaYrw3Dcle9U271Z_ic4GI8zI6E-Zz1a8MbEPerpl0I76302PBIhVIZVyyaw-Y2bN7FA3jLrCTkEcu0oeGtFV96yBDco3HngTqTXMuyGGGdzKOKhMs) ### Asks From [_JustPaid.io_](http://JustPaid.io) _(Loopfour)_, YC members and others are able to easily self-onboard, connect bank accounts and provide contracts to jump-start the process of agreed vs. charged bill analysis and manage payments. We’re excited to welcome an early adoption of users to not only alleviate their current headaches but also create an open collaboration of feedback together to better advance our solution to exceed your expectations.

▶️ Decoherence: Create video with prompts,"# tl;dr: ✍️→🎞️ [Decoherence](https://decoherence.co) is the easiest way to create videos with AI by using text prompts and music. We enable creators to quickly generate music videos or B-roll that matches their content. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1216864/cd976d12-1661-4738-9eea-fa5bcbb70c0e) # 😓 **Problem** Content creators often have audio content (music, podcast, etc.) that struggles with engagement on video platforms like Youtube, Tiktok, and Instagram. They want to use AI video generation to create a compelling visual pair for their content, but existing solutions are not accessible. A combination of costly hardware requirements, programming knowledge, and constant research upkeep prevents them from using the technology.   # **💡 Solution** Decoherence is an intuitive, no-setup application to create all of your generative videos. It gives creators the ability to work at 10x the speed: quickly generating B-roll content or animating their music in minutes rather than days. It works by analyzing structure in generated images, converting audio signals into motion effects, applying them over time, and stitching images together to make a full video.  See the full [product demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDlAyyQDuw8): # **🤖→🎨 Why us?** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1216864/f497f999-d57d-4287-9c12-2e3e7f8d7a78) We are engineers with experience bringing bleeding-edge technology, autonomous vehicles and next-gen internet satellites, into production at a global scale.  We met at Amazon Robotics where we shared a deep appreciation for robotics because it was **software that _literally_ moves**. In early 2022, we found a similar spark when we typed in a few words and received back beautiful images from AI image generators. We think things are always more fun when they **move**, so we applied our background in computer vision to bring the images to life in the form of video.  We learned to turn tech demos and research into products used by thousands at Amazon. We’re applying that experience to Decoherence by building a product that anybody can pick up and use.  # **🙌 Ask** **Interested in creating video?** Shoot us an email at \\ [getaccess@decoherence.co](mailto:getaccess@decoherence.co), and mention “**YC Launch**”!

Identifying pain, driving urgency, and gaining access to power are critical to successful B2B sales - especially in today’s market! Without visibility into their process, sales leaders struggle to make accurate forecasts, identify deals that are off-track, and onboard new reps effectively. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/630080/8ecee57b-d85c-4bb6-819d-d8b0ed4ee007) **🔎 The Solution:** Fabius uses data from customer intelligence tools like Gong and Chorus to overlay your company's sales methodology with what's happening in the field, leveraging LLMs to extract the ground truth around your opportunities. We score every deal against your company’s tailored sales process so you can replicate what works again and again. **For sales leaders** - this gives unparalleled visibility into their sales processes, so they can improve their forecasts, help course correct deals which are missing key steps in their methodology, and ramp up sales reps faster. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/630080/5281e3e4-5b22-406b-9b01-ba28f58619c9) **For individual reps** - they get just-in-time feedback on their sales calls to help them drive urgency and win more deals. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/630080/188dcb5f-5446-4ee1-ae91-b4ef2e5f5f06) We believe that Fabius is the best way to take the guesswork out of sales and help sales teams become more efficient and productive.

Tennr – The perfect prep before every sales call.,"Hi everyone, we’re Tyler, Diego and Trey — the team behind [Tennr](https://www.tennr.com)!\\ \\ **TL;DR** **We’re building an AI that uses your marketing docs and online research to create the perfect meeting prep before every sales call – in just one click.** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1196037/73b30101-f014-4ce4-9217-63225549d76c) ### # **🧐 The problem** It takes a lot of time to prepare like the top sales reps do. The top 1% of sales reps today spend hours daily: 1. researching their buyers in the news 2. re-reading through notes and past call transcripts 3. digging through product marketing docs and case-studies to find relevant examples to bring up. …Meanwhile, the rest of us 😳… well we: 1. **Lose context** bouncing between meetings 2. **Misunderstand** what our buyer’s company actually does 3. **Forget what our buyer** **said** they really cared about And of course we then fail to get buy-in, establish clear ROI, and subsequently lose deals :( ### \\ 💡 **Our solution** Tennr is an AI that understands your product, past deals and most importantly your buyer, to give sales reps and managers the perfect preparation before every sales call. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1196037/935d08c7-b9ac-4df4-a8a1-b32c0b8b0550) \\ 💥 **How it works** \\ To make the magic happen, Tennr uses 3 main sources of data to provide the context needed to generate useful prep as well as answer any questions you might have about an opportunity: 1. **Internal business artifacts**: Call recordings, CRM data, Marketing docs (white-papers, case-studies) 2. **External Data**: A blend of 3rd party sources that effectively replaces Googling your buyer’s company or LinkedIn stalking stakeholders. 3. **More** **Tennr** 🤯:  For each company you’re talking to, we create a ‘Deal Room’ on the back-end where we put everything Tennr has learned about that opportunity. You can then use that ‘Deal Room’ to ask questions about how a deal is progressing or strategize with the team about what is most likely to resonate with the buyer. ### \\ 📚 **Our backstory** Trey, Diego, and Tyler all met at Stanford. * Diego and Trey competed together for 4 years on the varsity crew team. * Tyler and Trey met as freshman roommates where they started an iOS consulting firm to get better at building apps while getting paid * All 3 studied Computer Science and focused on AI, design, and systems. ### \\ ❤️ **Our ask** * **If you lead a team of sales reps or are a sales rep yourself** and want to see what sales prep superpowers look like, grab some time with us [here](https://cal.com/holterman/tennr-15)! * **If you know someone in sales that might find this useful,** we’d love to be connected at [trey@tennr.com](mailto:trey@tennr.com). * If you like what we are building, share and upvote!",Diego Baugh,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c03bebc8db653c7bc17e788dac7c5d177e480b13.jpg,Otherimage_27811_1.jpg;Otherimage_27811_2.jpg;,27811
Versori - System & data integration platform,"**Hello YC!** 👋 Awesome to be here and proud to be part of this fantastic community. We’re Sean and Dan, the Founders of [**Versori.**](https://www.versori.com/) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69359&key=user_uploads/920068/f5ba23d6-ef01-4adc-ac46-181a9a2236d9) ### **The Problem 😫** The enterprise integration market is controlled by traditional system integrators (Accenture, Cognizant, Capgemini etc), who charge for professional services and manual development. Time, money and resource is wasted on manual system and data integrations. Complex iPaaS solutions aren’t easy, and easy iPaaS solutions aren’t complex. ### **The Solution 😊** Versori “Switchboard” is a no-code system and data integration platform, primarily for major retailers that lets them connect any internal system to any external system without hiring expensive consultants.  For example, Sephora used Versori to build an integration that imports 3rd party brand products into its own ecommerce site in a few clicks. Reducing integration time from 9 weeks to 2 hours. [Here’s an intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7T1z3nxoD0&t=3s&ab_channel=Versori) **Create data sources (connectors) in seconds, not weeks.** * Drag and drop or paste the URL to your API specs * Switchboard strips and stores the auth and server types, end points, operations and schemas. **Build complex and advanced integrations with no-code tools** * **_Transformer_** provides functionality to take data from multiple sources into a format suited for your target, with all the features you’d expect such as filtering, converting and mapping. * **_Selectors_** gives you access to any data from all previous steps in your board, allowing you to perform complex tasks such as merging or flow-control. * **_Data Mapping_** allows you to define mappings where some value in one system is equivalent to another value in another system. These can be defined up front in our dashboard, or interactively updated within your board. * **_Filter_** allows you to stop or continue execution of a workflow based on a set of conditions. These conditions can be as simple or as complex as your data requires, and can be combined with Selectors to compare data from multiple workflow steps. * **_Delay_** halts execution of the current message until a predefined duration has elapsed. * **_Batch_** aggregates all data received over a specified batch period before releasing the result to subsequent steps and is useful when integrating real-time APIs with bulk import/export APIs. * **_Trigger_** allows a board to be triggered manually or via a schedule instead of via an external API call * **_CSV Processing_** allows you to truncate, join and deduplicate CSV files * **_Splitter_** takes in an array and outputs multiple new messages for each element in that array **Deploy integrations and workflows your way** * Public Cloud * Private Cloud * On Prem * SDK ### **We can integrate your systems, that Zapier can’t.. ⚡️** You need the break free from the static guard rails of existing integration platforms! If your company has bespoke system or data integration requirements, that can’t be done with an existing IPaaS provider, please reach out to us at [sales@versori.io](mailto:sales@versori.io).

Defer: A zero-infrastructure platform for Node.js background jobs,"Hi everyone! We are Charly and Bryan, and we’re happy to present you [Defer](https://www.defer.run/): ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69350&key=user_uploads/1143800/14e200b6-6899-4313-9030-29ddc708dc4b) Defer allows developers to quickly create and run background jobs without infrastructure. Background jobs are vital in building responsive and resilient web apps by moving slow code outside the users’ journey (ex: pulling and sending data to external APIs, sending emails). ## Why are we building Defer? Bryan and I have been working for 10 years in startups of many stages (pre-seed to Algolia or Dashlane stages). In all those experiences, part of our work included crafting similar background jobs solutions and their internal dashboards, as Charly did at Algolia for the Shopify Integration Pipeline. We identified a gap between current solutions and actual product needs that leads to **a repeated waste of engineering time** (initial cost, support, and maintenance) and **bad user experiences** across all companies. As consultants, we also faced companies that **preferred to keep degraded user experiences** to not invest in R&D in background jobs. All those combined experiences led us to create Defer to help companies match **modern product criteria** (great user-perceived performance and an increasing number of integration with external APIs) with **minimum effort** while keeping the **developer experience at heart**. ## Our solution Defer enables developers to use a background jobs solution that matches their product needs without reinventing the wheel or building fragile layers. Defer brings a **unique developer experience** that makes it easy to create or transform existing functions into background functions (function version of a background job) **without the usual distracting boilerplate code** that current OSS solutions bring: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69350&key=user_uploads/1143800/8f9ece4b-ff95-4171-a3bc-e0cc82e73609) Defer’s infrastructure then **handles background function executions** with the configured parallelism and retries, **without infrastructure work or DevOps knowledge**. The Defer Dashboard allows developers to manage applications with multiple environments and **get a sense of their product’s health** with **analytics and filters-rich executions list** view: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69350&key=user_uploads/1143800/0024a5c8-a2d6-4c80-a7fc-57f8f26fb4c4) Finally, developers get **notified on Slack upon failure** and can quickly access the execution’s logs and business metadata to **narrow down the issue and keep users in the loop**. ## Focus on your product. Get started with Defer in a few minutes without refactoring or configuration, and start building delightful user experiences: * Defer comes with a [**free Hobby plan for developers** and small projects](https://app.defer.run/sign-up) 🚀 * **As a YC company** (current batch and alumni) [benefit from a generous YC Deal](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/deals/1652) 💰 * Defer is full-featured: you will find many examples [in our documentation](https://docs.defer.run/) 📖 * Want to talk about your use case?

Type – an AI-first document editor,"![](https://s3.gifyu.com/images/ezgif-2-b362c92d73.gif) Hi there – [Stew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stew-fortier/) and [Stefan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefanli/) here. We're building [Type.ai](https://type.ai). Type is an AI-first document editor. We help marketers and creators write high-quality content remarkably fast. Type makes it effortless to access the most powerful capabilities of today’s large language models. Type’s AI can instantly generate and transform any text – it picks up on your intent and the context of your document as you write. We’d love to give you early access [here](https://type.ai/). ## The problem Companies spend billions of dollars on content marketing each year, but creating great content is hard. Finding compelling ideas and articulating them in a way that will resonate with an audience requires constant experimentation and iteration. AI will radically reduce this friction by making it easier to generate and refine ideas, but it's still hard to get today’s large language models to give you what you need. You must either become a “prompt engineer” or use AI writing tools with rigid, template-based interfaces that constrain creativity and produce mediocre content. ### The solution We've built a flexible, fast document editor that lets a user quickly surface powerful AI commands by hitting cmd + k as they write. Type’s AI commands help with the slowest parts of writing, from generating drafts to rewriting content to suggesting what to create next. The more you write, the better Type’s suggestions get. Type’s AI understands the context of a document – it can generate or transform text quickly and accurately.  We combine the flexibility of a product like ChatGPT with a powerful document editor. The result: Type is fun to write in! ### The founders We started building this because we were surprised nobody else had. Writing is not a “one-shot” activity! You need a flexible canvas for refining your ideas as you write. [Stew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stew-fortier/) (CEO) is an entrepreneur with a lifelong passion for writing.

🔥 Wild Moose: Solve production incidents faster with Gen AI,"**TL;DR When you’re on-call and everything’s on fire, instead of frantically sifting through logs and going through other people’s code, our moose just gives you the answers.** [**Chat with us**](https://calendly.com/wildmoose-yasmin/15min) **to try it out.** **—-** 👋 We’re Tom, Yasmin, and Roei, founders of [Wild Moose](https://wildmoose.ai?utm_source=YC+newsletter&utm_medium=blog+post&utm_campaign=Launch+YC).  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69325&key=user_uploads/281723/afaf46a4-84f9-46c1-b638-ee353587eaa5) [Yasmin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasmin-dunsky-519a4ab2/) has an MBA from Stanford and is a third-time founder & CEO. [Roei](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roei-schuster-0ba818aa/) got a PhD at Cornell University focusing on Large Language Models (LLMs), and [Tom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-tytunovich-70a13886/) has had the dubious pleasure of fixing hundreds of incidents in production over his 15 years of engineering. ### **The problem** With developers spending over 30% of their time on production issues, and incidents leading to millions in lost revenue, there’s no need to say much about the headache that is production debugging. Instead, we asked Midjourney what a developer dealing with a prod incident looks like: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69325&key=user_uploads/281723/a629390c-47b7-403e-bae9-d523c690b62d) ### **Enters the moose** Debugging in production with our moose allows you to solve issues in minutes instead of hours, reducing MTTR 100x. It helps you avoid costly downtime, save time, and keep your SLAs in check. You’re able to: * 🕵️ Navigate through heaps of logs, metrics, and other people’s code * 🧠 Build queries like a pro for any observability tool (Elastic, Datadog, SQL DBs, etc.) * 🔀 Get next-step recommendations so you stay on track when the pressure is on and you’re flooded with data ### **How it works** **💪 We help you hit the ground running –** unlike humans, our AI is happy to wake up at 2 AM and get cracking, instantly up to speed and ready with useful data on the state of the system ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69325&key=user_uploads/281723/7468e24d-8b94-403d-a59e-98e0994ef3f6) **💪 You don't need to debug alone –** using Wild Moose is like having a fellow engineer take the grunt work off your hands. One who knows every part of the codebase, and who can process hours' worth of data in seconds ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69325&key=user_uploads/281723/92cb41af-6553-48f8-9277-dff3f74b0eaa) **💪 Learn more from the incident –** some companies learn from their incidents, others are just gifted with many repeat opportunities… To help you belong to the former, we automate your postmortem generation ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69325&key=user_uploads/281723/310efdc8-5c47-40a5-afcd-3203066cbc66) ### **Our technology** Behind a conversational AI experience, lie our special-purpose large language models (LLMs). Having cracked the way LLMs can be fed code and logs in real-time, we design models that efficiently ingest the massive contextual data about a given incident. Crucially, we also validate the produced answers against the original sources of truth, giving you trustworthy information when you need it the most. ### **We can help you fix production issues** If your company has 25+ developers, you measure the cost of downtime, and your observability stack includes Datadog, Sentry, and/or Elastic, we would love to help you manage production issues!

👾 Outerbase – Interface for your database,"Hi everyone – we are Brandon & Brayden from Outerbase. **📚 TL;DR** Current database tooling is poorly designed and historically been targeted solely at developers. Outerbase is a modern platform that allows you and your entire team to view the data you need whether it be in Postgres, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery or more. ### **🪨 The Problem** Getting access to your data is hard. Typically there are only a few people who hold the keys to it at any given company and they quickly become a bottleneck on data requests. The tooling around it is outdated and poorly designed, and not intended for the modern collaborative work environments. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1247130/86c6422c-a53c-41d7-a9fa-10c9e5362450) ### **⚒️ Our Solution** Outerbase provides an intuitive interface with granular access to your data. It has a familiar spreadsheet-like experience that anyone can use. Outerbase’s EZQL provides a sql-less experience through the use of GPT-3. You can take those same queries and create beautiful dashboards all in one experience. ### **⚙️ How Outerbase Works** We sit on top of most relational database types, including Postgres, MySQL, Redshift, BigQuery, and Snowflake. You simply provide your database credentials and Outerbase gives you a spreadsheet-like experience to view, edit, query, and visualize your data. Since access is based on your credentials you can easily control how granularly your team accesses your data. Our EZQL feature is powered by OpenAI and takes your databases schema and structures your questions/queries based on it. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1247130/8bf0e1cb-0788-47a1-84aa-8d91e6652aad) ### **🙋 Asks** Try Outerbase, simply [sign up](https://app.outerbase.com/signup) and get started with our demo database, or add your own database credentials in the connections tab. You can also [download](http://app.outerbase.com/downloads/Outerbase.dmg) our mac app. If you know of anyone trying to kick off the process of making data-driven decisions but doesn’t know where to start, please intro them to us!

👂 Oto: Get your life back from Tinnitus,"Hi YC, Ed and George here, the founders of [Oto](https://www.joinoto.com). Last year we launched our mobile app as a one size fits all solution for tinnitus. We've since spoken to hundreds of users and it's clear that they need a more personalised approach, with live support from a real person. So, we are thrilled to announce our new 1-1 therapy program. **_Tl;dr:_** _Oto teaches your brain to stop noticing your tinnitus using the latest scientifically proven techniques. Our personalised program combines 1-1 therapy from a world class audiologist with an award winning app._ [_Book a free consultation today._](https://calendly.com/otohealth/tinnitus-consultation-ed) ### ❗**Why do we exist?** Tinnitus or ringing in the ears affects 1 in 8 people, **and there’s no cure**. It impacts mood, concentration and sleep and in 40% of cases is hugely debilitating. Getting reliable help is not easy. People usually drift between ENT doctors or audiologists searching for effective treatment. Nearly all are told that they need to learn to live with it. However, it shouldn’t be like this. **Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been proven to be the most effective way to manage tinnitus.** Unfortunately, not many clinicians are aware of this, and in the US, CBT can only be delivered by a licensed therapist. Very few therapists are trained to deliver CBT for tinnitus specifically. [Hear from our lead therapist Anna Pugh why we built the program.](https://youtu.be/xkvfhHkc6pE) _Anna is a hearing therapist audiologist specialising in tinnitus therapy._ # **💡 How does it work?** Right now if you have tinnitus, it probably makes you feel anxious, sad or angry. That’s normal. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69248&key=user_uploads/691438/430a79fa-381f-4a1d-9a4c-51b8fca11131) CBT changes that emotional reaction so that you stop perceiving the tinnitus to be a threat. Two things then happen: ✔️ You stop noticing your tinnitus all the time. ✔️ If you do notice it, it doesn’t make you feel bad. **What’s included?** We'll create a tailored 3-month tinnitus program for you that includes: * 🖥️ **Online 1-1 Therapy:** 6 therapy sessions with a world class audiologist. * 📱 **Toolkit App**: access our digital program anytime, anywhere, and for as long as you need. * 🙋 **Instant Support**: get answers to your questions and access to our team with your own personal guide. ### **🙏🏻 Our Ask** * **Get in touch** - If you struggle with tinnitus, or know someone that does, we’d love to speak.

Meticulous: AI to catch UI bugs without writing or maintaining tests,"[Meticulous](https://www.meticulous.ai) is a tool to catch UI bugs automatically, eliminating the need to write or maintain any frontend tests. It does this by recording user traffic and simulating it on new versions of code, before that code is released. It takes 15 minutes to setup and has zero maintenance burden. ### How does this work? 1. Install the Meticulous recorder onto your web application onto an environment of your choice (dev, qa, staging, prod). This records user sessions. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69242&key=user_uploads/155134/586c1136-eab3-4b25-8d1e-0e36e91f2f58) 2. Integrate into your CI, five lines with GitHub Actions ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69242&key=user_uploads/155134/52ae41bd-dc65-49a8-bad1-7441c07a35ad) 3. Submit a pull request. 4. Meticulous identifies relevant recorded sessions and simulates them on the base commit and head commit. **It does without ever hitting your backend or causing any side-effects**. It takes a sequence of screenshots at key points and generates screenshot diffs. You can either build your frontend app within CI or give Meticulous a preview URL to simulate against. No backend needed. 5. Meticulous comments on the PR showing any visual diffs it detected ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69242&key=user_uploads/155134/25e526f0-4f8d-4f59-8d83-003c9e8a28dd) 6. Click to review the diffs. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69242&key=user_uploads/155134/9ecab14a-35f2-43a5-8a08-243b22408565) 7. If the changes are expected, hit ‘approve all visual differences’, merge your PR and the baseline images will automatically update. If there are unexpected differences (i.e. bugs), submit a new commit with fixes and Meticulous will re-post with an updated set of diffs for you to review. ### Why should I use this? * You get broader test coverage using Meticulous than by writing a test suite with Cypress, Playwright or a recorder tool. This is because real users explore every configuration of your application. Customers often find that internal sessions (staging, dev) achieves coverage exceeding what they had in-place previously. * Less flakes. We’ve employed novel techniques to radically reduce the number of flakes in UI tests. Chat with us to learn more. * You don’t have to write or maintain any UI tests. Meticulous automatically updates your pool of tests as you merge new code changes and as users use the new version of your application.

However, making a long-lasting injection takes a lot of trial and error and the time between iterations is long. Key challenges include: * **Using manual work & intuition is slow**: Typical teams manually mix and match chemicals to optimize the amount of drug that’s loaded into the spheres and the rate of release of drug * **Trial and error is cumbersome:** Because changing one variable may have multiple effects  * **Scale-up is unpredictable:** Even if something works at a small scale, batch-to-batch consistency during scale-up is uncertain because production is done in large reactors ### 💡**OUR SOLUTION** We utilize custom robotics and AI to solve the problems with building microspheres.  * **We automatically mix & optimize formulations:** We use a closed-loop robotics + AI approach so there’s minimal manual work * **We reduce trial & error with AI predictions:** We generate 50x more data than most formulation teams and use that data to train AI. This unique data enables us to make better predictions than others. * **We build small batches, faster:** So we can QC batches more frequently and scale up predictably ### ❤️**OUR ASKS** Introduce us to friends who work in Pharma.

We fully manage the infrastructure, autoscale with your data, and charge based on usage with no fixed costs. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/61370/f468f5b0-8088-4982-abd8-a45e143f02a8) ## **💥 The problem: real-time data processing is too hard.** Many companies have adopted Kafka to collect and route their event data. But if they want to actually _do_ anything complex with that data, their options today are to use a complex solution like Flink or dump it in a data warehouse for batch processing. ## **⚡️ The solution** After leading streaming teams at Lyft and Splunk, we’ve seen how critical real-time data can be. At Lyft this infrastructure was vital to the operation of the product, powering features like dynamic pricing, ETAs, safety, and fraud. We’re working to bring it to everyone by solving the hard infrastructure and UX problems of existing solutions. It’s three steps to get started writing real-time queries: 1. Tell us how to connect and authenticate against your Kafka cluster 2. Configure the source and sink topics 3. Write SQL From there, our system will compile your query into an efficient dataflow program that responds to events within milliseconds and pushes results to Kafka. We charge purely on usage (based on data in, query complexity, and window sizes) with no minimums. Our system automatically scales with your data volume, and there’s no need to manage clusters or provision fixed infrastructure. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69175&key=user_uploads/61370/8789103e-9032-4cf3-bc1e-3f9bcf03a026) ## **What can you use this for?** * Compute real-time ML features * Detect fraud and abuse as it happens * Turn your daily analytics jobs into real-time queries * Filter/redact/aggregate your logs before indexing, or turn them into metrics * Reduce costs in your data warehouse by pre-aggregating before ingestion ## **The backstory** Micah spent four years at Lyft and Splunk building streaming platforms on top of Apache Flink and Kubernetes. Teams shipped impactful features backed by that infrastructure, but it still wasn’t easy enough for non-experts to adopt. Users wanted the same UX they had for batch: just write SQL, don’t worry about operations, scale, or the nuances of the infra. But the underlying tech wasn’t good enough. We started Arroyo because we believe this goal is now achievable, but it requires looking beyond existing technology like Flink. That’s why we’re building a new, cloud-native stream processing engine in Rust. We’ve designed it from the ground up for near-instant rescaling and recovery even with very large windows (something that can take hours with Flink!) by separating storage and compute. And by leveraging WASM for user-defined functions, we can run user code efficiently and securely. ## **Get in touch!** If you use a stream processing system like Flink or Spark Streaming, or would like to make use of your event data in Kafka, we’d love to talk! We’re excited help you solve your real-time data problems or turn an existing batch workflow into a streaming pipeline.

Pando Bioscience: Innovating drug discovery,"### Who we are? The pharma industry is struggling with drug development as they mostly focus on single proteins. However, proteins are functional through a vast number of interactions, which have proven to be highly correlated with diseases. Pando is a drug discovery company. Using synthetic biology, we reproduce networks of human proteins and study how they interact, innovating cancer drug discovery. ### Our science We study protein interaction in a high-volume and high-resolution manner, so that information previously hidden from studying single proteins can be revealed to discover new drugs. Our research published in _Cell_ reported a strong correlation between mutation-induced protein-protein interaction perturbation and various diseases. For example, we have found that protein interactions involving TP53 (a well-known tumor suppressor protein) have a much better prediction power in patients’ survival than TP53 alone. We are starting with cancer, but our platform can be applied to a wide range of disorders like heart, respiratory, and neurological diseases. ### Why now, why us? There is a lot of advanced research in academia (many papers contributed by our CTO @Yang), but few applications in the industry. Now is the time! We are experts in the field. @Will joined the synthetic biology unicorn Ginkgo Bioworks as an early employee and spent 5+ years designing DNA. @Yang spent 6 years at Harvard Medical School before joining Ginkgo. His postdoctoral research at Harvard lays the foundation for what we do. Our science has been published in _Nature_, _Cell_, and _Nature Genetics_. Dr. Marc Vidal serves as our Scientific Advisor. He is a world-leading professor studying protein networks at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. ### Want to be part of it?

UpTrain - Open-source tool to observe your ML models ⚙️ 🔧,"**TL;DR:** UpTrain is an open-source ML observability and refinement tool. It helps data scientists observe how their ML models are performing in production and continuously improve them over time by automatically retraining them on cases where the model accuracy was low. **Hi everyone!** Sourabh, Vipul, and Shikha here, and we’re the team behind UpTrain.  Sourabh (CEO), previously founder at fitness tech, where he spent most of his time improving their AI models rather than, well, working out 🏋️ Vipul (CTO), previously worked at Meta and Bytedance, where he was busy applying his doctorate knowledge (yes, the Ph.D. kind) to improve their ML models 🔭 Shikha (CMO), an ex-VC, where she witnessed the magnanimity of AI problems from the inside of her portfolio companies and this is where she got her eureka moment 🔔 ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69166&key=user_uploads/588096/a21aa066-6198-48c0-8c27-354f6e4ba73a) ### **Problem (The Origin Story 📖)** During the last 7+ years of building and deploying ML models, we have been constantly frustrated due to a lack of good tools that could answer one simple question - “Are our models working as expected in production?“ Sourabh first experienced this issue while working on self-driving cars at a Fortune 500 company. Then again he faced similar issues at his startup. The only way the model issues were highlighted was through reading loads of customer complaints, and it was excruciating to see their (hard-earned) revenue churn due to model degradation **😩.**  Coincidentally, Vipul was solving the same problem at the big techs, where he built internal observability tools and optimized model retraining processes. The three founders spoke to 100+ ML practitioners to validate their hypothesis and got a unanimous yes! In fact, during one of the user interviews, we learned that an innocuous bug in the model deployment code led to 3+ weeks of wasted debugging efforts and losses of millions of revenue dollars 🤯 We are building UpTrain to prevent you from experiencing the same agony! ### **The Solution 💡** UpTrain is built specifically for Machine Learning. We natively support all the things an ML practitioner requires to observe and improve their models. ✅ Complete visibility into your model’s online health via real-time dashboards  ✅ Automatically collects outliers and edge cases  ✅ Identifies data distribution shifts  ✅ Monitors quality of object embeddings ✅ Model explainability  ✅ Continuously retrains and improves your model  Cherry on the cake, we are Open-source! Some of the biggest AI-first startups are adopting UpTrain to fulfill their ML observability needs. ### **How to use UpTrain 🤔** Install UpTrain from pip, just tell it what all you want to observe, and UpTrain handles all the complexities in the background. Something as simple as below: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69166&key=user_uploads/588096/3f9f9f08-df84-480d-af42-62a6af0950c2) We DO NOT require you to change any part of your production pipelines and readily integrate with all major ML libraries and tools. In fact, we are running a limited beta program where we provide a no-strings-attached pilot and do all the heavy lifting to ensure seamless integration of UpTrain in your systems.

EdgeBit - Secure your software supply chain,"tl;dr: [EdgeBit](https://edgebit.io) automatically inventories software dependencies, ensures they are trusted, and monitors vulnerabilities – securing your software supply chain. For security teams, we help you meet new compliance requirements about the libraries and packages in your products. For engineers, we make vulnerability investigation/patching streamlined, so you can get back to writing code. Hi everyone, we are Rob, Russell and Eugene, the team behind [EdgeBit](https://edgebit.io). We’re on a mission to make software secure by default. EdgeBit deeply understands how your app is built, what makes it up and how it’s running. That knowledge builds up trust to make developers lives easier, and your entire server fleet more secure. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69144&key=user_uploads/230598/b3341e0d-c53a-49b4-a31a-c5d9a5fa6c8c) Left - [Eugene](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugene-yakubovich-4640604/) - Chief Architect and low level hacker. He worked on pathfinding algorithms at Lyft, container networking at CoreOS and performance optimization in his high frequency trading days. Center - [Rob](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robszumski/) - CEO and product leader. He was a Director of Product at Red Hat working on the OpenShift/Kubernetes platform after their acquisition of CoreOS (YC S13). Right - [Russell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/russellhaering/) - CTO and master of backend systems. He ran security engineering at Okta after their acquisition of ScaleFT, the zero trust access management startup he cofounded. ## The Problem: securing software still feels like throwing problems over a wall Security teams have important work to do – meeting a maze of compliance rules against a constantly moving target of dependencies, frameworks and deployment platforms. Automation is key, but security teams aren’t experts in each app, so “open a ticket for any vulnerability found” is a typical workflow. This is a firehose for app teams, and tickets don’t contain the context needed for a speedy investigation. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69144&key=user_uploads/230598/201aef87-ad12-4842-9b9d-f423f8ccd315) Looking beyond compliance, real attacks are happening via software dependencies. For a single library, it’s tricky to securely download, integrate, sign and verify it…and very hard for 100s of dependencies across multiple apps. An enterprise can use [40,000 open-source software packages](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/05/supply_chain_security_efforts/) each bringing another 77 dependencies. An end-to-end system across the build→scan→run→monitor is required to stop these attacks. Dependencies are fragmented across OS packages, standalone binaries and containers, but a single view across all is required to understand the full attack surface. ## EdgeBit: Map your supply chain from build to production in real time ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69144&key=user_uploads/230598/9872f16b-3980-4c64-bf6f-fe47a5f82262) EdgeBit builds up context and trust by observing your software from build until deployment to your server fleet. How does it work? Install EdgeBit into your build pipeline and your server fleet/Kubernetes cluster via a tiny agent to immediately enable teams to bring vulnerabilities under control: * Security: track workload signatures, provenance and prevent malicious modification * Compliance: build a real time inventory tracked back to the software’s bill of materials (SBOM) * Engineering: prioritize vulnerability investigation based on deep context * Enterprises: track patching across teams. The next log4j will come, and it’s a huge endeavor without real time inventory across all tech stacks and packaging formats. ## Try out EdgeBit Security teams can [install EdgeBit](https://edgebit.io) to track their supply chain and even help compliance managers do their job without getting engineering involved. Remove frustration from your vulnerability response program by connecting your teams together and take control back from noisy scanners. Securing supply chains is just a step in our journey. Using trust profiles between systems is key to a zero trust security posture. We’d love to chat with you about acute compliance needs or long term security goals of your organization.",Rob Szumski,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/60e818e2ea2e9958d82e367fd34da1797653d7ce.jpg,Otherimage_27809_1.jpg;Otherimage_27809_2.jpg;Otherimage_27809_3.jpg;,27809
"LaunchFlow - Design, develop, deploy in VSCode","## TL;DR LaunchFlow makes it easy for developers to build and deploy cloud infrastructure. We do this by providing a VSCode plugin that bundles all of the developer’s external tooling into a single interface. **If you’re interested, join our private beta waitlist at** [**launchflow.com**](http://launchflow.com)**.** Hi all, we’re Caleb and Josh from [LaunchFlow](http://www.launchflow.com). Our goal is to increase developer velocity by making deployment as simple as one button click. ## The Problem While developing a real-time ML platform at Alphabet, we realized that **it often takes longer to deploy a model to production than it takes to develop the model itself**. We found that 90% of the effort was spent on connecting a multitude of frameworks and tools into a reliable system. Each framework has its own process for properly deploying to the cloud, which leads to countless delays related to **authentication**, **configuration**, and data **consistency** at scale. We created LaunchFlow to ensure the last 10% of a project doesn’t take 90% of the time. ## The Solution LaunchFlow enables the developer to build and deploy **directly inside of VSCode**. Users design their system using our novel drag & drop interface that generates templates with managed connectors included. Developers can then immediately start developing inside a local container that mirrors their system as it would be deployed on the cloud. Once finished developing, they can **deploy everything with the click of a button**. All of this is done entirely inside VSCode. We’re currently focused on real-time (streaming) processing, but will support many more workflows in the future. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69132&key=user_uploads/1215135/bc71ee21-41f6-4b4f-b57f-d8085f331f51) With LaunchFlow **developers** will: * Reduce incidents by getting production best practices out of the box * Catch bugs before you deploy by having a local replica of their entire system * Increase their velocity by automating IO connections between popular frameworks and storage systems * Get time back by reducing the burden of their deployment pipeline ## Our Ask * Join our private beta waitlist [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXIt0Vx69--OeHZAtiaGEySbTuGN7XT0RkzkXSvFtaqPAwxw/viewform). * Share this post with anyone who may be interested! * Do you have any feedback or would you like a demo?

Apollo -- Managed marketplace for basic back-office services,"> Hi everyone! My name is Gul and I started [Apollo Group](https://www.apollo-group.io/). Prior to starting Apollo, I was the Founder/CEO at Airlift — a q-commerce marketplace in Pakistan that raised [$120m+ in venture financing](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/17/pakistans-airlift-raises-85-million-for-its-quick-commerce-startup-eyes-international-expansion/). ### **💡 What We Do** Apollo is building a managed marketplace for basic back-office services — examples include lead generation, basic desk research or building high quality financial models. Through our internal technology, we are able to break projects into specific sub-parts, assign each part to a specialist, and conduct QC (Quality Control) before submitting the deliverable to the client. With process excellence, getting work done on our platform becomes significantly faster, cheaper and higher quality (relative to freelancers on Upwork). ### **💥 The Problem** As entrepreneurs that have built companies before, we cannot help but observe that there is no easy way to delegate basic back-office services. Examples of back-office services range from lead generation and bookkeeping/taxation to basic desk research and building cashflow forecasts. Currently, the best option is to delegate things to freelancers on Upwork — this is neither turnkey nor does it yield the desired output. The process requires significant management bandwidth to the extent that it often doesn’t save time. The end output is also inconsistent and does not meet global standards. We believe that an outsourced virtual back office is an obvious missing piece in the toolbox for the modern enterprise. In the decades ahead, organisations will have smaller full-time teams and a growing reliance on virtual back offices — companies will also dial up or dial down their spend on back-office services based on evolving business needs. ### **💪 Our Solution** Users can submit a project on our platform. Within 15-minutes of the project being submitted, users can see a pricing quote that they need to confirm. After that, the user is able to receive high-quality output (typically within six hours of the original submission). Imagine that John Smith is an investment associate at a VC firm. He is evaluating a Company that uses generative AI to make the process of building decks easier. John can log into Apollo’s platform, submit a research project to identify the current traction of 15-20 market leading technology companies in the presentation design industry, and get smart about the space very quickly. Our solution is cheaper, better and faster than working with freelancers on Upwork for the following reasons: * **Agent Specialisation —** Our agents specialise in specific areas, enabling them to build advanced expertise. * **Active Management —** Every project first gets routed to a manager who provide active guidance on how to go about the effort. Every project again runs through a manager for quality assurance before being delivered to the end-user. * **Agents in Developing Countries —** By building agent networks in low-cost environments, Apollo is able to deliver on an unparalleled cost advantage. Our agents are based in low-cost environments in developing countries — this ensures that John pays $25/hour for whatever he needs done. Additionally, as a managed marketplace, we have multiple ### **👪 Our Customer** Our customer is any individual or organisation that requires high-quality and reliable back-office services. We are seeing very significant traction for Apollo with early-stage startups that have limited bandwidth. ### **🙏🏻 Our Ask** 1. If you are a multi-stage investor that is looking to back a team that has a track record of raising significant capital before and building a consumer service that achieved $90m+ in annualised revenue, then we’d love to hear from you. 2. If you are a full-stack engineer anywhere in the world, and if you’re looking to join a team that brings a unique mix of determination and being imaginative, then we’d love to talk!

Rubber Ducky Labs: Stop recommending ski jackets in June,"![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69112&key=user_uploads/1164034/d71009b4-6b77-430f-a071-18fbccf522c5) **TL / DR;** Rubber Ducky Labs helps e-commerce companies avoid tone-deaf product recommendations — like featuring ski jackets in June. It works by combining machine learning with human expertise to produce the best product recommendations. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69112&key=user_uploads/1164034/3234f8dd-48e2-4edc-8525-f63699ee47e9) # Introduction Co-founders Alexandra and Georgia have over a decade of experience shipping products in fashion tech, B2B ML tooling, and high-scale data infrastructure, and are passionate about making the state of the art in machine learning effortless and easy to understand. Alexandra’s career started with her dream job working on clothing recommender systems for fashion tech companies, and she and Georgia founded Rubber Ducky Labs to be the suite of dream tools that they wished were available for building recommender systems. # The Problem You’re a PM at a fashion tech startup. Your app is recommending that you buy ski jackets. It’s June. Looks like nobody told the algorithm that summer isn’t ski jacket season, and now it’s your job to figure out whether or not your algorithm will start driving away users. If your team’s metrics dashboards can’t answer the question, you’ll need to file a ticket for the data science team to run some analysis. Looks like it’s going to be at least a week before you have an answer. # The Solution With Rubber Ducky Labs you’ll have an answer within minutes. Now, you’ll be able to understand whether you looked at a lot of ski jackets recently, so it’s just happening to you, or if your colleague recently flipped a switch to promote a brand that happens to carry a lot of ski jackets. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69112&key=user_uploads/1164034/918010a5-c9d2-49f6-b1a0-44086fb79f57) Our solution was developed from over a hundred conversations to answer the question of “what’s going on with my recommender system?” With Rubber Ducky Labs you can: * Explore your data visually - with product images * Drill down from aggregate metrics all of the way to individual item or user journeys * Consolidate and debug your company’s business logic * View annual and seasonal trends * Facet, segment, and filter and your data * View side-by-side comparisons of models or ranking changes # The Vision The mission of Rubber Ducky Labs is to allow people with domain expertise — like product managers, merchandisers, marketers, growth hackers, and founders — to easily build intuition about and incorporate domain knowledge into their recommender systems. Today’s launch is just the first step. We want to help you do everything from consolidating business logic to previewing side by side model comparison to launching production experiments, all within RDL’s tools. If this sounds like something you’re interested in, we’d love to build together. # Technical Details Setup took 90 minutes of time with our first user. Under the hood, Rubber Ducky Labs is a fully hosted web app that connects directly to your data warehouse on the backend to pull your custom metrics and data. No need to deploy any services or change any code, plus you get to bring your own model! Additionally, the web and API are authenticated with Auth0 to keep your data safe. # Our Ask We’d love to learn more about your recommender system, and start identifying areas for improvement.

{🟦} Blocksfabrik: Create your own design system without all the work,"Hi! Alex and Ryan here - we’re super excited to launch [Blocksfabrik](https://blocksfabrik.com/#ref=yclaunch)! --- **TLDR: We built a way to create design systems that stay in sync across design and code. Teams are using us to design better interfaces and develop them as fast as using an off-the-shelf component library, but with the flexibility of a bespoke design system and none of the tech debt.** **Ready to ship better product experiences? We would love to help, so please book a slot for a quick chat** [**here**](https://calendly.com/d/zkc-hbp-8n2/blocksfabrik-founders)**, or reach us directly via email at** [alex@blocksfabrik.com](mailto:alex@blocksfabrik.com) or [ryan@blocksfabrik.com](mailto:ryan@blocksfabrik.com) ### **The Problem** Creating your own design system takes a ton of effort and experience that is hard to come by. And once they’re built you’ll have to maintain them in design and code indefinitely. Off-the-shelf component libraries get you off the ground, but are disconnected from design and hacking around their limitations becomes a liability as your product grows. What if you can design and build as fast as with a component library, but with the flexibility and quality of a bespoke design system? # **The Solution** Configure your design system in the Editor and Blocksfabrik will take care of the rest — creating the component code, Figma assets, and documentation. It’s like having a full-time design system team, without needing the budget. ### **How It Works** **(1)** Define your design tokens in the Editor (including color palette, sizes, fill styles, etc) and the specifics of your interface components (from shapes to interaction patterns). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69110&key=user_uploads/919864/31b5b5d1-c6a8-4fca-b639-1a203bcab90b) **(2)** Publish your design system, and you’ll get a private NPM package, Figma assets, and documentation that are all in sync. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69110&key=user_uploads/919864/56ce7431-2f21-40d9-932c-dd2c1edbf728) **(3)** Since Blocksfabrik creates components for both Figma and code, your Figma assets will share the same properties, and behave identically to the components in code.

Vector: Unlock the value of your customer conversations,"# Retention is the new Growth! 🚀 # **💬 Words Matter 💬** Everyday customers tell their vendors exactly what they want, but nobody's listening.  In fact, businesses continue to archive mountains of Customer Success emails, Sales call transcripts, marketing chatbot data and technical support conversations across disparate platforms that aren’t connected.  Imagine the customer experience you could provide by unlocking the value of knowing **exactly what your customer needs, when they want it.**          B2B conversational data is the most underutilized asset in a business’s revenue strategy.  Vector is on a mission to tell a sales rep what they need to upsell or retain a customer in 30 seconds, based on months of multi-channel conversations.     We are Joshua and Nick, former Sales Engineering executives who’ve identified preventable problems in B2B customer experience, where the answers lay within the unstructured conversational data.      \\ ✅ **The Solution: Vector** ✅ **In the Future:**  Vector will be the solution to the often sought after Customer 360.  Based on conversational analytics, Vector will aggregate, analyze, and provide the ability for your teams to create an experience that your customers desire.  **We will provide the “R” in CRM that does not exist today.**   ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1125363/31ecbf3b-a2be-47cc-960f-6121b1ef2b99) **Short-term:**  Far too often, Sales Representatives and CSMs change accounts leaving their customers in a position of starting over with someone new.  The process of repeating answers to the same questions asked in the past is an awful experience, and a massive waste of time.  Vector makes sense of your unstructured conversational data so that, AE to AE or Pre-Sales to Post-Sales knowledge transfers are executed as if the same person is working the account.   ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1125363/0c3f52fe-84da-425e-9539-15c4e3851a57) **⚡️ Get Involved ⚡️** If you’re a B2B company who wants to provide a better experience for your customers, email Joshua and Nick at [Founders@getvector.ai](mailto:Founders@getvector.ai) to start understanding what your customers are actually saying. \\ Follow [Joshua](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuaperk/) and [Nick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholasamasters/) as we develop this journey with [Vector](https://www.linkedin.com/company/getvector/about/?viewAsMember=true). ",Nick Masters,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/7ec778a8b3a021e64170c19a24a90da88647dd45.jpg,Otherimage_28178_1.jpg;Otherimage_28178_2.jpg;,28178
CodeComplete - GitHub Copilot for Enterprise,"### **TLDR** [CodeComplete](http://codecomplete.ai) is GitHub Copilot for Enterprise. Large companies can't use Copilot because of the security and privacy risks, so we're building a self-hosted version that’s also fine-tuned to the company's codebase.  **If you (or if you know anyone else who):** * **Would like to use Copilot at work but cannot, or** * **Would like a version of Copilot that’s fine tuned to your enterprise codebase** Please reach out to us at [founders@codecomplete.ai](mailto:founders@codecomplete.ai) or schedule a time with us on [Calendly](https://calendly.com/lydia-codecomplete/intro).  — --- Hi everyone, we’re Max and Lydia, and we’re building CodeComplete: an AI-powered code assistant built for enterprise companies. We’re incredibly excited about the advances in generative AI and are on a mission to transform the way developers work. Our code completion product is the first in a suite of AI-powered dev tools we’d like to build.  ### **The problem** We love GitHub Copilot, but in order to use it, you need to send your code to GitHub, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Many large enterprise companies strictly forbid this due to **security and privacy concerns**, so they cannot leverage AI-powered dev tools to multiply their productivity. Also, the underlying **Copilot model is not tuned to your codebase**, so you don't always get relevant suggestions. It’s best practice for developers to use their company’s frameworks and libraries. However, without fine tuning, code generation models can suggest generic code, which decreases legibility and introduces technical debt, performance issues, and security holes in the codebase. ### **The solution** CodeComplete is a **self-hosted AI coding assistant tool that's fine tuned to your codebase**. We train powerful code generation base models on your codebase so we can deliver more relevant suggestions. We deploy these models directly on-premises or in your own cloud, so your valuable intellectual property stays with your company. With CodeComplete, your team can leverage cutting-edge AI technology to be more productive, quickly ramp up developers, and write better code while staying security compliant. **Demo** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=69046&key=user_uploads/1160505/0dbe9136-8d6c-415f-a09e-c6f81bba8ddb) ### **Why we’re building this** Max wanted to use GitHub Copilot at Meta, but leadership explicitly blocked him from doing so. We believe AI-powered dev tools are the future, and we think they can be especially powerful and deliver value at larger companies. We want to set companies up for success in the long run by helping the millions of developers at these companies leverage new AI technology. **Buy vs. Build** This is not a core competency for many large enterprises. Buying a solution will save millions by freeing up engineering resources and catapulting dev velocity.  ### **Ask: How you can help** * Connect us to an engineering leader at a large company that needs our product. [Email us](mailto:founders@codecomplete.ai)! * Connect us to engineers who really want to use Copilot but cannot. [Email us](mailto:founders@codecomplete.ai)! * Try out our product.

highlight.io - Open-source session replay & error monitoring,"![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68975&key=user_uploads/241768/1b79410b-8b41-4e1e-8869-c4ccfe7d2130) ## **TL;DR:** [highlight.io](http://highlight.io) is an open-source **session replay and error monitoring** tool that helps teams reproduce hard-to-crack issues and understand product usage. We enable developers to understand WHY bugs are thrown on their web apps to eliminate the noisy alerts they get from more traditional monitoring tools. [highlight.io](http://highlight.io) is already being used in production by **2k+ developers and 80+ companies**. Get started for free at [app.highlight.io](http://app.highlight.io) and give us a ⭐️ at [github.com/highlight/highlight](http://github.com/highlight/highlight). ### **The Problem** How many times have you gotten an alert from Bugsnag or Sentry, and dismissed it because you weren’t sure about what caused it? And how many of you have an endless backlog of errors that your team _should_ triage, but haven’t gotten to yet? We’ve found that when debugging an issue or customer request, **the toolset that you use is responsible for delivering one thing only: context**. And if there’s any gaps in this context, engineers are left in the dark. To solve this, at our last companies, we found a lot of value in instrumenting a session replay-like tool, (similar to Logrocket or Fullstory), paired with an error monitoring tool (like Bugsnag). In fact, we’ve built these sorts of tools ourselves to hackily solve the problem. Enter [highlight.io](http://highlight.io). ### **The Solution: Session Replay 🤝 Error Monitoring** With a simple `yarn/npm` import in your frontend and an optional import in your backend, [highlight.io](http://highlight.io) gives you session replay and error monitoring out of the box. This means that you can: * Replay exactly what a user was seeing at the time of an issue/bug. * Reproduce the browser dev-tools for every user session, including the network requests, errors, and more. * Access all of the errors and exceptions (both frontend and backend) thrown in your app, paired with session replay. Lastly, given the privacy-sensitive nature of the product, we have a very powerful privacy API that you can take a look at in our docs [here](https://www.highlight.io/docs/session-replay/privacy). ## **💬 What’s Next?** We’re just getting started! We have plans to go way deeper into your observability stack to give you ALL of the visibility you need; that means logs, traces and more!

⚡ Pyq - Easy AI integration into applications,"**TL;DR :** Pyq makes it easy for developers to build features powered by AI. We do this by providing simple APIs to popular open-source models that any developer can instantly start using straight from our website. Hello everyone! We’re Emily Dorsey and Aman Raghuvanshi and we’re the team at Pyq.  We’re working to make AI easy, after facing difficulties getting AI integrated at our previous jobs. Aman (CEO) previously worked in ad tech, and watched his team hire additional engineers just to manage their AI stack. Emily (CTO) was previously at Microsoft, and spent more time than she’d like wrangling Azure.   Did we…pique your interest? Sign up [here](https://dev.pyqai.com/)! **The problem 🤔** ML models have grown in popularity and complexity, but getting started using them remains a challenge. The process involves several steps: identifying a model that might work for your scenario, sorting out where to access and how to use that model, getting it running in the cloud. These all require domain knowledge, and can take a lot of time. **The Solution** 🦸 Enter Pyq. We’ve deployed some of the most popular ML models on our managed infrastructure for anyone to use via our API. We maintain these models in production so you can focus on using them to improve your application. You can use us to go from 0 to 1, and beyond. You can even fine tune these open source models with us if you want to customize them.  Our models are good for specific use-cases, and often address problems that cannot be solved by popular large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s GPT. We can also deploy, host and manage proprietary models. We’ll manage versions and supply a dashboard to track essential metrics.  **How it works ⚙️** Sign up and get started! Below you can see our model zoo, which allows you to test and see the various open source models we currently have available. We also have some sample applications, also available through the API.

We started Whalesync because we repeatedly saw people spending weeks architecting multi-step automations only to find them brittle and unreliable. While we love automation tools, they’re really not built to handle true data syncing where you connect deeply and bi-directionally. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/689259/f59ab897-31e7-4717-8c1d-5353077f4f28) ### **The solution: simple, no-code data sync** Whalesync is the no-code tool built to handle data syncing. In a few minutes, you can hook up your apps and have them 2-way syncing in real-time. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/689259/05a48b3c-e3a4-49cc-870c-9b8564835d98) ### **Use cases: pSEO, internal tools, + much more** Whalesync works by connecting different tools, so there are a TON of different things you can do. A few of the more popular use cases: * 🔎 Launch thousands of **programmatic SEO pages** (Airtable x Webflow) * ⚒️ Build an **internal tool** on top of your production database (Postgres x Notion) * 💻 Create a scalable **no-code app** (Bubble x Airtable) * 🧑 Personalize hundreds of tier-1 **ABM landing pages** (Airtable x Webflow) * 📝 Manage your **blog** (Notion x Webflow) ### **How it works** 1. Pick the tools you want to sync 2. Tell Whalesync how the data maps 3. Turn on sync, we do the rest ✅ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/689259/c61a0dd3-5b9f-4be0-aef9-14310076108c) ### **🙏 Asks** * [Try it out](https://www.whalesync.com/airtable-webflow/choose-connectors) and let us know what you think!

BidSight 🏗️ - Modernizing pre-construction for CRE developers,"### **Tl;dr**: BidSight makes it easy for commercial real estate (CRE) development teams to manage and collaborate on complex pre-construction workflows. Today, CRE developers manually track pre-construction workflows across hundreds of project documents, which leads to extremely costly errors. BidSight’s platform acts as a single source of truth for development teams, eliminating errors and saving them millions. [Learn more today!](https://www.bidsight.io/) Hi everyone! We’re Alec, Connor, and Josh from [BidSight](https://www.bidsight.io/). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68929&key=user_uploads/1122874/e2f756ee-d963-4a1b-b098-b60906f34233) ### **🚧 The Problem: The Pre-Construction process is broken** During pre-construction, commercial real estate developers rely on numerous stakeholders (architects, engineers, contractors, etc.) to help design, permit, and plan construction projects within their budget. However, development teams currently have to utilize a patchwork of non-specialized tools (email, excel, PDF editors, etc) to manage stakeholder workflows and output, creating error-prone, non-standardized, and siloed processes. The current process forces development teams to recreate the wheel from scratch on every project and causes them to lose millions of dollars on each project due to error driven delays. ### 📖**Background** Alec (CEO) spent 5+ years working for one of the largest commercial real estate developers in the United States and dealt with this problem on a daily basis. He spent a significant amount of time searching for a software solution that addressed his highly specific needs; however, none of the non-specialized tools in the market worked. After speaking with numerous other developers that faced the same problem, Alec decided to recruit Connor (ex-Square) and Josh (ex-Google), who have spent their careers developing software, to build the product he always wished he had. ### **✅ Our Solution: Collaborative workflow and data management** A pre-construction specific workflow and data management platform that acts as the single source of truth for development teams. * **🧑‍🤝‍🧑Team Management**: Add your full team (internal and external) to a project, with clear permissions structures based on roles and responsibilities * **📅Schedule Management**: Create project schedules that update in real-time based on the completion of tasks * **📄Drawing & Document Management**: Upload all of your project drawings and our OCR engine will automatically categorize them, allowing for clear version control and change tracking * **✔️Task Management**: Assign, track and prioritize tasks, which are directly tied to project documents and deadlines * **♻️Templated Workflows**: Create templates and checklists for your specialized workflows to standardize processes ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68929&key=user_uploads/1122874/12194d69-7dc5-4da1-8d19-bfd9c968d4e5) ### **💰 Opportunity: Value beyond savings** In 2022, $1.8 trillion was spent on construction in the United States. Recent studies have shown that 75% of construction projects are delayed and less than 1/3 of projects come within 10% of their original budget. This means that there are hundreds of billions of dollars wasted each year due to project delays! Rather than wasting these funds, they should be reallocated to enhance our built world. ### **🙏Ask: How you can help** * [Connect us](mailto:sales@bidsight.io) to US based CRE developers in your network * [Share BidSight](https://www.bidsight.io/) with your network * If you are building a company within the real estate & construction space, we would love to connect to learn about your experience ([founders@BidSight.io](mailto:founders@BidSight.io))",Alec Dunn,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c7b3f6f38061d4d0ecef46cd27ffb04b3bfc2eb3.jpg,Otherimage_28127_1.jpg;Otherimage_28127_2.jpg;,28127

By teaching our body’s immune system to recognize and kill the mutations that cause cancer, we can eliminate the majority of all cancer deaths. **OUR SCIENCE** A normal cell turns into cancer when it develops a mutation that makes it grow aggressively. Surprisingly, a small number of these mutations account for the vast majority of cancer deaths. The immune system usually doesn’t recognize these mutations, but our technology platform enables us to train the immune system to recognize and attack these cancers. Our first product is a vaccine for the treatment of lung cancer that targets the KRAS mutation, the most common mutation in cancer, accounting for about 25-30% of all cancer deaths. In the long run, we envision a world where every adult receives our vaccines annually – preventing the majority of cancer deaths. **OUR TEAM**  Our team includes some of the leading cancer vaccine experts in the world including: our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Liz Jaffee (Chair of President Biden’s Cancer Advisory Panel) and our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Mark Yarchoan (principal investigator of multiple international cancer vaccine clinical trials). Our team is led by our Chief Executive Officer, Jen Herbach, who has more than a decade of biotech industry experience including with Amunix (the second largest oncology pre-clinical stage acquisition). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68893&key=user_uploads/1145057/259fde86-331d-4477-83f2-f7f6e5461adf) **INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE**  If you are interested in learning more about our approach to treat and prevent cancer, please reach out to us at [contact@adventrispharma.com](mailto:contact@adventrispharma.com)",Jen Herbach,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/a4adf9402b75db976cbf8cf9bc9daa3538d621d2.jpg,Otherimage_28158_1.jpg;Otherimage_28158_2.jpg;,28158
tBTC 💸 The truly decentralized bridge between Bitcoin and Ethereum,"Hey everyone! We’re [NuCypher](https://www.nucypher.com/) (YC S16), contributors to [Threshold Network](https://threshold.network/). ### **Tl;dr** tBTC is a trust-minimized bitcoin bridge that lets users wrap their BTC in exchange for tBTC tokens that can be deployed permissionlessly in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. Bitcoin is the most pristine digital asset and it deserves a decentralized financial system that's equally pristine. Mint tBTC and use your BTC as collateral to borrow, lend, LP, and more on Ethereum. ### **👪 Who is it for** Are you a **BTC hodler, hedge fund, token fund, crypto VC, family office, DeFi OG, or high net worth individual who holds Bitcoin** but are concerned about the risk of permissioned and centralized bridges like wBTC? Do you worry about centralization risks like censorship or the bankruptcy/liquidation of a centralized custodian like what happened with FTX/Alameda and renBTC? Then tBTC is for you. # **💡** How does it work? **Decentralized Custody** It's simple! Rather than sending your BTC to a centralized custodian, you permissionlessly interact with the Threshold Network smart contract on Ethereum and your BTC is custodied by the decentralized network of Threshold stakers (under the hood some fancy cryptography is happening using distributed key generation and threshold signatures). You deposit your BTC in an address generated by Threshold stakers and receive tBTC in your Ethereum wallet. **All this can be done via the** [**Threshold dashboard**](https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC). **Your Passport to DeFi** Once minted, you can use your tBTC like any other token on Ethereum and across the DeFi ecosystem: to lend, borrow, yield farm, safeguard in smart contract multisigs like Gnosis Safe, and more… # **💪 Why we built tBTC!** We built it for ourselves. We’ve been through multiple crypto cycles and have seen first-hand the risks of centralization and the ensuing loss of funds, all the way from Mt Gox to FTX/Alameda, more recently. We know not to send our BTC to an opaque centralized custodian just to put it to work. Bitcoin is the most pristine digital asset and it deserves a financial system that’s just as pristine. ### **🙏🏻 Our Ask** If you want to put your BTC to work, mint tBTC and get your passport to DeFi (but make sure you understand the risks, first): [**https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC**](https://dashboard.threshold.network/tBTC) Our community is here to help, come join the fun in [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/threshold), learn more about tBTC, and maybe even contribute to the DAO!",MacLane Wilkison,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/bb89221187fd16c1d525ab7ca52c75baa417d2de.jpg,,1183
🚀 Modulari-T 🧬 Unleash the full power of the immune system,"# Modulari-T AWAY! Hi YC, this is [@David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-white-modulari-t/) and [@Stephanie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephmok/) from [@Modulari-T](https://www.linkedin.com/company/modulari-t-bio/) launching! ### **WHAT WE DO** Modulari-T is a cell therapy company that can teach your immune system to attack and cure cancer.   We are a dynamic group of scientists bringing together protein engineering, synthetic biology, and immunology to create the world’s most powerful cell programming platform.   By introducing our optimized gene sequences inside immune cells, we can create treatments that are 2x potent as chemotherapy, but that avoids 90% of harmful side-effects.   Today, cell therapy has a high failure rate and is difficult to produce, leaving 20M patients without hope. Modulari-T has the technology to fix this, bring hope to cancer patients, and supercharge the cell therapy market to grow beyond $50B by the end of the decade.   ### **HOW YOU CAN HELP** Connect us with people in the ecosystem! Do you know anyone working in cell therapy or oncology? We want to talk to them, to know about their pain points - academic, biotech/pharma or physicians. [We are hiring!](https://modulari-t.breezy.hr/) Are you a synthetic biologist or immunologist? Ready to join a new adventure? Become part of the Modulari-T squad (Mod Squad!) in beautiful Montreal! ### **THE SCIENCE**: We have built a platform to produce a new type of receptor, the Modular Actuation Receptor Complex or MARC, that mimics the modular architecture of immune receptors. These receptors can be used to reprogram immune cells to recognize cancer antigens and direct an immune response against tumor cells. Compared to CAR-T cells, MARCs have twice the tumor clearing power and avoid causing immune exhaustion to ensure a long lasting response. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ItKO7egaIuynMGKcNjoT2YMqkANZ6E6oNxe5RyIisJ47KOaWhchZU9NpFHXfqkGu_EIB6--huJ4KOnT_5IqHMQut2czid5T8krpDXcZ3iSYTSEL9y2tyAg2IfOYSLic_Uaiz7dOJbcH6dELlc-MPEA) The MARC’s unique architecture allows us to link any extracellular cue with the required signalling outputs across different pathways to achieve therapeutic success. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1161771/abbed6b1-a7be-43e4-821c-8daa69fff47a) Oncology is only the first step; the MARC platform is applicable to autoimmunity, neurology, regenerative medicine and more! ### **HOW WE CAN HELP YOU** Are you a Cell Therapy company? Let us show you how Modulari-T’s MARC platform can help your development. Our platform can do anything but we can’t do everything alone. That’s why we want to partner with you and bring hope to as many patients as we can. ### Thank you! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68886&key=user_uploads/1161771/773beb5d-3dbb-4905-8b5e-c5e453a33517)",Stephanie Mok,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/7e84b9438e87a1adf29d92d2525871a030ab8753.jpg,Otherimage_28205_1.jpg;Otherimage_28205_2.jpg;,28205

Welcome: A webinar platform designed to drive revenue,"TLDR: Webinars are one of the most effective ways to get leads. Welcome focuses on creating webinars that drive engagement and revenue. **The Problem** Webinars can often be stodgy and un-engaging. Existing tools like On24, Zoom Webinar or GotoWebinar are focused more on registration and analytics than the live experience. As a result, webinar attendees are often left bored. **The Solution** Welcome is a webinar platform with a built in content creation studio. This mean you can add music, videos and useful on-screen overlays to complement your webinar. For example, here is a new feature we recently released that allows you to put on-screen calls to action for your attendees. **Interested in trying it out?** Fill out our [demo request](https://www.experiencewelcome.com/demo) form if you or your marketing team would like a live demo.

Invopop - Global sales tax compliance with a single integration,"Hey YC! 👋 \\ We are Sam and Juan, co-founders of [Invopop](https://www.invopop.com/), and we are on a mission to simplify Sales Tax/VAT compliance, globally. ### **🧨 The problem: new sales reporting requirements** Tax authorities around the world are starting to require that companies report **every sale**, in **real-time** for tax recording purposes. Yes, every **single transaction,** in real-time (i.e. **electronic invoicing**) This is **already required** in most **LatAm** countries and India, and the majority of **European countries** are making it mandatory in the next **1-3 years**. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68825&key=user_uploads/1138452/fcc7d3af-be8e-41da-9e85-45dd7b4b4286) ## **🎉  Our solution: one API, global compliance** Our API receives the information of a **sale in a simple open-source format** and **converts it to a locally-compliant invoice,** including * Sync with tax authorities reporting requirements (e-invoicing). * Generate a custom-branded PDF invoice and send it to customers. * Integrate with the company’s stack (e.g. ERP, billing, payments, reconciliation). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68825&key=user_uploads/1138452/457c38ec-ba3d-49b8-a18c-4f8e1ddc7fef) Invopop is already live in **Colombia, Spain & Portugal**. Many more coming soon: Mexico, Italy, Peru… ### **🚀 Why we built Invopop** **Sam** was previously **co-founder & CTO of Cabify**, and as they expanded to LatAm, complying with the e-invoicing requirements became a nightmare. As he could not find a global provider to solve this, he built Invopop. **Juan** worked as a **consultant in Mexico** and was blown away by how complex the e-invoicing system was. When he learned this is becoming mandatory in Europe, he knew Invopop was needed! ### **🙏🏼 Ask** If you want to make sure your company complies with the new regulation: Schedule a demo with us [here](https://savvycal.com/juan-moliner/15min-public)!",Juan Moliner Malaxechevarría,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/3bdf46f92ac0b5b127e3059c9b6af2f7bac0295d.jpg,Otherimage_28079_1.jpg;Otherimage_28079_2.jpg;,28079

A few examples of what reps need to stay on top of in each call: 1. Who the prospect is and how to build rapport 2. [What to respond to common cold call objections](https://www.trellus.ai/post/five-common-cold-call-objections) 3. Any qualification questions that need to be worked through - and the prospect's response 4. Their own delivery cadence - tempo, talk time, etc. 5. When to go for the close and book the next steps **For managers** - it is hard to effectively supervise and train a team of reps since a team of reps has far more (combined) hours to make calls than a manager has time to review them. Existing sales intelligence tools like Gong / Chorus are commonly used for recording and review but offer limited help in coaching reps because [the analytics are less focused on prospecting calls and the feedback is often delayed.](https://www.trellus.ai/post/sales-coaching-is-broken) # **The Solution** Trellus solves these issues by giving your sales reps a real-time AI-powered sales coach that is available 24x7 to them.

Glass Health — Frictionless software for learning and practicing medicine 🩺,"![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68710&key=user_uploads/76099/471cfb16-bd60-47be-8b49-b60d0faa66a6) **🤔 PROBLEM** We saw physicians struggling to manage an ever-expanding world of complex clinical information from heterogeneous sources. We also experienced this problem first-hand in the clinical environment. Our friends in medicine had phones and email accounts full of disorganized journal articles, tweets, clinical images, lecture slides. They could not easily reference these important digital assets when needed to enhance their care of patients. **🩺 SOLUTION** Glass is a medical knowledge management platform, aka “Notion for doctors.” Our platform is tailored to how clinicians capture, organize, store, and retrieve medical knowledge. We’ve created medicine-specific knowledge management features, including: * Schemas, Scripts, and Cases: store content in special page templates tailored to common medical knowledge constructs. * Pearls: capture snippets of clinical knowledge encountered during patient care and later organize them in your notebook. * Linking and Visualizations: easily backlink pages and later view their relationships with medicine-specific visualizations. * Community Library: view and save pages published by others in the Glass Health Community. * Glass AI: draft differential diagnoses and clinical plans using generative AI. ([Glass AI Demo](https://glass.health/ai)) * Team Collaboration (coming soon): track key information about patients in a HIPAA-compliant team collaboration environment. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68710&key=user_uploads/76099/ba37b973-9395-4320-b3dd-9771299ce305) These features help clinicians bring all medical knowledge assets they encounter throughout their careers into one place. This helps them achieve clinical mastery faster and leverage their ever-growing digital external brains to better care for patients. **📖 FOUNDER BACKGROUNDS** [Dereck Paul, MD](https://twitter.com/dereckwpaul) was a resident physician in internal medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, and a medical student at the UCSF School of Medicine. [Graham Ramsey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graham-ramsey/) interned at Watsi (YC W13) and designed and built the EHR at the telemedicine company PlushCare. He was an early product team member at Modern Fertility (YC S17) until its acquisition by Ro in 2021.

"🚀 Middleware 📊 : A unified observability platform for cloud native, microservices and distributed apps","Hey YC! 👋 \\ \\ I am super excited to launch [Middleware](https://middleware.io)—a **real-time observability platform** that brings all the **metrics, logs, traces, and events** into a single timeline so you can monitor your distributed apps and cloud native platforms in real time. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68705&key=user_uploads/1149383/7c01ff47-1f21-4647-9254-b2951dc8d1b8) ### **Problem with existing legacy products** Current observability solutions are built to monitor monolith architectures, not distributed and microservices. This results in the following problems:  * Surface-level information makes it **extremely hard to debug** issues. 🧐 * Costs 💵 to monitor everything in the infrastructure and applications are **incredibly high**. * All the data live in separate apps like logs, metrics, traces, and events and can’t **correlate to causation**. Because cloud native produces more data than ever, it’s become more challenging to understand what’s happening inside applications and infrastructure. Unfortunately, the result often **wastes engineering time** tracking incidents, creates alert fatigue, and, yes, costs a fortune. ### **Why we founded Middleware** I faced this problem when building my last startup. While building out the backend, it was **challenging to monitor microservices and Kubernetes**, as there was no all-inclusive cloud monitoring tool available. My few early engineers from **Splunk** and **Newrelic** faced this problem as well. After speaking to engineering and IT leaders at several other companies—and they were facing the same problem—we started to work on Middleware full-time. ### **Our solution to cloud native observability** Middleware is a **real-time observability platform** for cloud-native, microservices, and distributed apps that brings all the metrics, logs, traces, and events to a **single timeline**. This empowers **dev and ops teams** to find and debug issues faster.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68705&key=user_uploads/1149383/84b686ed-f3f2-4a40-9ad4-b4fec457d860) Additionally, our **AI-powered algorithms** collect and analyze data from across your entire infrastructure to spot signs of potential problems before they even occur.  Middleware offers a wide range of observability from **infrastructure** monitoring, **logs** monitoring, application performance monitoring (**APM**), **synthetic** monitoring, **database** monitoring, and real-time **alerting** solution with cost-effective prices. ### **What our customers say about us!** Cliff from **Puresend** - \""_We migrated from Datadog to Middleware because we absolutely love their unified view. It's such a simple but incredibly useful tool. This, among other features, made it a no-brainer for us to migrate. We monitor our logs, metrics, and traces at a very affordable cost. I highly recommend Middleware as the best in class for cloud-native monitoring._\"" Eduardo from **Berliner Philharmoniker** - “The Digital Concert Hall only uses cutting-edge technology, and Middleware was able to provide that with its all-in-one monitoring solution and near real-time metrics.” ### **Reinventing observability for the future 🔮** Our mission is to change how companies **observe infrastructure and applications** cost-effectively. Our tools provide everything you need to **remediate issues** faster while getting observability data growth under control. It provides real-time insight into your cloud-native infrastructure, applications, and business. * Vendor agnostic by using and contributing to **Open Telemetry**. * Store only the data that you need to save on **costs.** 💰 * Correlate the traces from the **browser to the front end and back end** with logs and metrics. * Using **AI to predict** any anomaly and possible downtime. ### **Our ask/ how to reach us with contact detail 🗓️** 1. Try Middleware and give us feedback. We love to work with **YC companies**. [TRY AT LEAST FREE FOREVER PLAN!](https://app.middleware.io/auth/register) 2.

Drift Bio: The operating system for life sciences data,"[Drift Bio](https://driftbio.com) is the next-generation tool for life sciences organizations to manage and analyze their data. Who are we? We’re Evan and Len, the cofounders of Drift. We’re passionate about life sciences and the ability of software to transform the way life sciences do business by fixing their software. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68655&key=user_uploads/229820/89e8e191-d016-4642-a3a5-ac9392fe6fe7) ### **Why life sciences software?** The practice of life sciences has undergone more change in the past decade than the past century. Today, life sciences companies have to analyze large amounts of data without clear best practices, and this work is often done by hand and requires software engineering to scale. Data scientists lived that way too, ten years ago–but now they have tools to help them manage their overhead and output 10x more than their predecessors. Life sciences practitioners deserve the same. The amount of analysis life sciences companies have to do is dizzying. Genomics, flow cytometry, scRNA, PCA, CRISPR, proteomics (do you prefer DDA or DIA?), and more. People need answers and breakthroughs. Software that requires life sciences companies to deal with this headache, instead of abstracting it away and scaling it across their whole organization, is a key bottleneck to success. ### **Great, so how does Drift help?** Drift is a platform that is specifically tuned for life sciences organizations. We help you scale your work and make it easy to use. How? We help you access popular open source tools, manage your workflows (even with custom code across several languages!), get into the cloud, store your data, share it with collaborators, and more, all without having to manage environments or clusters. All that in just one platform. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/KgBFOBnezzIc8qdQAQdWvVADYXBqJ2LCEgtMK603O8j-Skmh9g9CjCxqaROi1XSlpMXNhVpg2_Llhf5YYGqGECuuOFi6JuAf9AGb9oWm1jbYFoSawv1gbek4Z29KQkqbA4wdC_WZNiQ9q1k0vTp0jtfHKs1nnsS8nlhGSPUM_2sjzkZQ3tdeWoAuSfvAnA) At its core, Drift is a platform for data that creates different entry points for everyone across any life science organization to get their data in the cloud, analyze it, and make their work reproducible in a shareable way. We do this through our in-house management tools, which you can use to access popular open-source libraries or deploy your own software IP. By using Drift, it is all in the cloud and easy to use. And without even having to change your code, you can turn it into a GUI so that others can use the software.  ### **How do I get started?** If you work at a life sciences organization, we want to talk to _you_! Tell us about your use case and we’ll tell you how Drift can help. Email us at [team@driftbio.com](mailto:team@driftbio.com) to talk. And if you are a bioinformatician who wants to contribute, or you know someone who does, please send them our way too.

OutSail Shipping - Sustainable wind-powered container ships,"# TL;DR OutSail Shipping is a company founded to economically move maritime freight using wind power. You can help us by introducing us to decision-makers at global freight forwarders, global manufacturers and distributors, or anyone that ships in volume to the state of Hawaii. # Introduction We’re Arpan, Bailey, and Joseph, cofounders of OutSail Shipping. We’re a group of hardware engineers who have collectively brought to life a diverse assembly of satellites, rockets, and EVs. # The Problem Maritime shipping burns 300,000,000 tons of fossil fuels every year. This contributes 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions and 60,000 pollution-related deaths per year. In addition, fuel burn can account for up to half the cost of operating a modern cargo ship. Fuel costs have risen, and are expected to continue to rise through the coming decades. Shipping demand is expected to double by 2050, and contemporary steamship lines have no viable plans to decarbonize. # The Solution For thousands of years of maritime history, wind was the energy source of choice. Given modern advances in forecasting and fluid-dynamics, wind energy is once again the economically best solution for maritime freight. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68642&key=user_uploads/1077630/79d94db3-3f2f-4be9-83a7-569ab9638306) OutSail Shipping will design, build and operate purely wind-powered container ships. This new class of vessel will decarbonize maritime shipping while reducing costs. Our first service: A container liner between the US West Coast and the state of Hawaii, positioned to compete with a $200M existing market of ocean going barges. In this segment, we will deliver lower prices at twice the speed. # Our Ask: The logistics world is complex and opaque. We need the YC community’s help to find and connect with our customers! ### How you can help decarbonize shipping: 1. Please introduce us to decision-makers at large global freight forwarders like UPS, Flexport, and Expeditors. 2. Please introduce us to decision-makers at global manufacturers and distributors like Sysco, Gerber, and Georgia-Pacific. 3. Please introduce us to anyone you know who ships in volume to the State of Hawaii.

8vdX - Extend your seed extension with a ‘seedex booster’ of up to $1M,"**We are excited to announce the launch of 8vdX Seedex Booster, a new addition to our expanding product portfolio at 8vdX. This product offers early stage startups the opportunity to access seed extension debt of up to $1 million.** Until recently, we were focused on providing bridge to Demo Day loans to current YC batches. However, the current market environment has given us the opportunity to expand our product offering.  The 8vdX Seedex Booster aims to solve some of the fundraising challenges currently being faced by founders including; * Not enough funding runway to meet the performance benchmark expectations of series A investors * Decreased valuations that require founders to achieve significantly higher targets in order to avoid a down round  * Raising seed extension rounds can be challenging in the current environment 8vdX's Seedex Booster program augments a startup’s seed extension raise with up to $1 million of additional funding with founder friendly venture debt. **How it works is pretty simple:** **8vdX is offering to contribute up to 25% of a startup's seed extension round**, with the remaining 75% sourced from insiders or others. Our ticket size is between $250k-$1 Mn, capped at 25% of your seed-ex round. Here is an example of how it would work: * Let’s say you are a startup which has just launched a **$1 Mn seed-ex round** and applied for the 8vdX seedex booster. After evaluating your startup, 8vdX gives a commitment of $250k representing 25% of the total seed-ex round.  * **We will disburse the $250k** along with the $750k equity investment from other investors. _If you raise $750k in multiple tranches, we can make pro-rata disbursements_. * Maturity of up to 18 months or Series A closing, whichever is earlier _Assuming, the following terms have been negotiated and agreed upon by both parties:_ * Interest cost:  * cash interest of 1% per month ($2.5k) that you pay each month and * bonus SAFE of 5% i.e. ($125k) with the same valuation cap as the seed extension investors.  _8vdX allows for flexibility in selecting a combination of cash interest and bonus SAFE._ * Repayment schedule: The seedex booster will be repaid with the Series A funding. However, founders have the option to create an amortization schedule to prepay the loan or extend it upon maturity. Overall terms are founder-friendly terms as there is **no prepayment penalty, no collateral, no personal guarantees & no enforcement action.** **Please apply at** [**8vdx.com**](http://8vdx.com) **or email us at** [**zeronote@8vdx.com**](mailto:zeronote@8vdx.com) **Our aim is to help you achieve your maximum potential and successfully raise Series A funds.** How do we know this approach works? We have firsthand experience using it to drive growth and secure successful fundraises for startups. In fact, our own business model was developed through observing startups leverage our capital to accelerate their growth and secure successful fundraises. We are thrilled to have already partnered with over 20 YC startups and look forward to supporting you as well.

FlexDesk - Booking engine for coworking space,"👋 Hey everyone, we’re [Clark](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clark-jacobs-19a86665/) & [Dhanvi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhanvi/) from FlexDesk. **_Tl;dr:_** _Through FlexDesk, your employees can search and book from a network of 7,000+ coworking locations worldwide. For employers, FlexDesk makes it easy to create spend policies, track bookings, and streamline billing across all employees, geos, & brands._ ### **🥴 Problem** **1 - Search and discovery:** The coworking landscape is fragmented. Less than 65% of people live within a 50 mile radius to a WeWork location. 75% of workers have experienced it taking longer than 30 minutes to identify and book a coworking space. **2 - Spend controls and tracking:** It is currently hard to create and enforce standardized spend/booking controls. Companies have reported employees renting $400+ daily conference rooms to serve as their ‘personal office’. **3 - Payments:** Employees are currently required to pay for each booking using a credit card and submit for reimbursement. This is cumbersome for both employees and the company’s Accounting department, especially when dealing with multiple currencies. ### **🔥 Solution** **1 - Booking engine:** Search and rent from a network of 7,000 coworking locations worldwide - including WeWork, Regus, and thousands of local brands. **2 - Compliance + system of record:** Create and enforce custom booking/spend policies. Track and analyze all bookings to inform and refine coworking strategy. **3 - Streamlined billing:** One bill across all employees, geos, and brands. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/494003/9795eb02-917f-4ec0-ba42-c3880873f753) ### **💵 Bottom line impact** FlexDesk is a **win-win-win** across all major stakeholders at a company. * **For Real Estate teams:** Eliminates manual work that previously took up 15% of their workweek. * **For Finance teams:** Unlocks 10% savings compared to going direct with a single coworking brand. Unlocks 60%+ savings compared to a traditional lease strategy. * **For People teams:** Empowers employees with the freedom of choice to find a coworking space that fits their needs and within a short commute. ### **🤔 Why do companies use coworking space?** * **Distributed workforce:** Hiring across the US/world, while simultaneously downsizing and even exiting office leases given low utilization + high opex. * **Dynamic space needs:** Established an ongoing need to support employees with space for in-person collaboration, to meet with clients, and to escape WFH. * **Flexible and cost-efficient:** Coworking space offers companies the flexibility to address each of these needs at a significantly lower cost than a traditional lease. **Enter FlexDesk to offer spend controls, data visibility, and a booking engine with global coverage 🌎** ### **😎 How to sign up** If your business **currently uses coworking space or is thinking about it**, we would love to chat with you or the appropriate person at your company.

We also have an awesome **Slack app** and **browser extension** ([download page](https://www.pluspassword.com/download), also free). \\ \\ \\* With enough malicious intent, one technically can see the plaintext of the password by inspecting the value attribute of the password input field or listening to the POST request when the form is submitted (although most websites only send the hash of the password over the wire). But the thing is, if someone has that much malicious intent to begin with (i.e. going out of their way to dig up the plaintext of the password), you probably shouldn't be sharing the password and giving this person access to your account anyways.\\ \\*\\* We never store anything on our servers that can ever decrypt your encrypted passwords (zero-knowledge).

Turntable - Transform data at warp speed,"**TL,DR:** Turntable is a collaborative tool to create and manage data pipelines- built from the ground up with AI. To start, we’re focused on reducing the time and cost of transforming data within DBT, an open-source data engineering platform. Check out our first drop, [**DBT copilot**](https://www.turntable.so/copilot)**.** ### **🐌 Problem** Despite being one of the most important parts of a modern business, data transformation tools are often hard to use, slow, and uninspiring. Data teams spend the majority of their time finding the right data, creating pipelines, and responding to ad-hoc requests. With the added issue that recruiting data talent is difficult, data pipelines quickly become a bottleneck for product development and business learning. ### **⏩ Solution** Our first product is a [DBT copilot](https://www.turntable.so/copilot) that allows DBT users to do in minutes what they previously could do in hours or days. Our copilot currently supports: * generating or modifying DBT code * writing DBT schema and documentation * generating code for sharing DBT models in BI or visualization tools Watch a demo of the copilot [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHQpry2Ctok). In the future, you’ll see us launch more features and integrations to make it easier to find and contextualize data within your analytics codebase and collaborate with your teammates. ### **📚 Backstory** We’ve all either worked on data teams or have been customers of data teams that have been blocked on data pipeline work: * Justin led commercial data science at Cruise where he managed a team of data scientists that spent 70% of their time managing data pipelines in DBT. * Ian was the tech lead for growth & data engineering teams at Pinterest and Stripe, where he had to build internal tools and hacks to get around data pipeline constraints. * Wally led product for Twitter’s Home Timeline team, which would often be blocked on the creation of new metrics and data pipelines- slowing down product development and learning. Together, we started Turntable because we believe that generative AI has created an opening to build a new standard for data transformation tools. ### **🙋 Asks** * If your company uses DBT, reach out at [team@turntable.so](mailto:team@turntable.so)! (bonus: we may help you save >50% on your DBT costs 🤑). * If your company doesn’t use DBT, we’d love introductions to data teams at companies that do",Wally Gurzynski,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/4dd6e671ee7cc7bd3c5f6fac5c9ed80c85a1eb0d.jpg,,28078

Mantys - Modern day business planning & analytics tool for SaaS startups! 🚀,"👋🏼 Hello! We are Mantys and we are a Business Planning & Analytics tool with a focus on helping SaaS startups get **real-time visibility of their ARR Cycle**. If you struggle to know what your contracted, live and realised ARR are at given point of time or need to go through a lot of manual effort to reach there, we can help you. **The Problem** \\ As companies grow, It becomes increasingly difficult to track and forecast their Contracted ARR, Live ARR, Realised ARR, Churn, expansion, etc. due to: * **Data sitting in disparate locations:** Contracted ARR sits in CRM(Salesforce/Hubspot), Billed ARR sits in a billing software(Stripe, Chargebee), Churn sits in CS software(Gainsight) or Excel sheets, so on and so forth. * **Most of the tracking ends up happening in Google/Excel sheets** which leads to dependency on individuals, high chance of errors and inability to handle multi-dimensional data As a result, founders/CFOs are not able to answer fundamental questions like what their ARR is, how much is actually realised, what is the onboarding cycle, how will it impact cash flow etc. at any given point of time leading to governance issues and lack of actionable insights. \\ **The Solution**\\ Thus, we are building Mantys, a SaaS platform that helps companies: * **Get and track all their real-time data** – including financial and business metrics – in one place, simulate different scenarios, get insights faster, and be empowered to plan for the future. * Integrate with varying sources of data (like CRM, Accounting tools, etc.) and **automate the manual processes**/grunt work (reduce the time taken to generate reports and metrics by atleast 60%): * **Get access to best-in-class planning and analysis templates** to reduce the onboarding time to hours than months We know every business is complex and has it nuances.

🛒 Viddy - Shoppable video experiences for e-commerce,"**🚀 TL;DR Short-form video is the new default medium of content consumption, but e-commerce hasn't adapted and has been static text & images for +10 years. Viddy bridges this gap by bringing familiar and interactive video UIs that are shoppable to e-commerce.** Hi everyone👋 Harris and Nihar here from Viddy! We’re on a mission to change the future of online shopping. ### **🚨 The Problem** Consumer behavior is shifting towards consuming more short-form vertical video (thanks to TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, YouTube Shorts, etc.), yet e-commerce has been static text and images for over 10 years. E-commerce brands and their storefronts have struggled to adapt to this video-first trend, leading to their conversion rate and engagement consistently dropping year over year. Lower conversion rate and engagement leads to lower revenue, retention, and LTV. # ### **🎯 Our Solution** We've built familiar video UIs (such as Instagram Stories, animated carousels, swipeable TikTok feeds, among others) that can be easily embedded on an e-commerce website. See examples below: ![](https://t20558217.p.clickup-attachments.com/t20558217/75c857dc-99f2-43e9-9bca-7019b7908c91/img1.png) Brands can feature custom call-to-actions within videos (for example: taking a quiz, booking a demo, viewing a product page, etc.). See our mobile optimized video player in expanded view below: ![](https://t20558217.p.clickup-attachments.com/t20558217/054c0633-9fb3-4424-bd51-e0561c6ee71b/img2.png) Everything is configurable and customizable in terms of what videos a brand wants to use to the look & feel of our video player. See our CMS below: ![](https://t20558217.p.clickup-attachments.com/t20558217/3f897964-6394-486e-8fa9-d421676c5953/image.png) **You** [**try a live demo here**](https://www.viddyapp.io/?utm_source=yc_launch_post&utm_medium=yc_launch_post&utm_campaign=yc_launch_post&utm_id=yc_launch_post#live-examples) **here** **to play around with our video experiences firsthand!** # # 🧐 **How it works** 1. Upload your video assets to the Viddy CMS 2. Add any call-to-actions you want within your videos 3. Select which video UI you want to use (Stories, Carousel, Floating Player) 4. Copy code embed and place on your site and voila! It usually takes 1-2 days to get live and all our customers have seen a +10x ROI. # # **💬 Backstory: we come from e-commerce** We come from the e-commerce industry and have led growth and experimentation of large DTC brands. We led a men's skincare brand that struggled to educate men on how to use skincare products (what does each product do, how much, how often, which order, etc.). Explaining this with video always performed better than static text, but getting people to engage with YouTube or Vimeo embeds wasn't great. We noticed that video UIs that are on par with mobile social apps are not readily available to non-technical website managers (a growing segment with the advent of Shopify, Webflow, Wix, etc.) and we're here to fix that. # # **⚡️ Our ask** * **If you know any folks at e-commerce brands and can make a warm intro, please email us at** [**founders@viddyapp.io**](mailto:founders@viddyapp.io) * **Want to join the platform?

From a management point of view, engineering resources dedicated to internal tooling are wasted as they should be focusing on customer-facing products. For developers, it’s a chore to work on unloved parts of the codebase that aren’t a priority for the business. And for other stakeholders in Product, Ops and Support, there’s never enough capacity to build the tools they desperately need, while the ones they have are slow, cluttered and the UX is often poor. ### **🙌 How does Noloco help?** [Noloco](https://noloco.io?utm_source=bookface&utm_medium=forum&utm_campaign=postgres) is the no-code platform for teams to instantly create internal tools from databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Airtable & Google Sheets. Once you connect your data source (e.g. PostgreSQL), Noloco automatically builds an app for you from your chosen tables including collection views (e.g. tables and kanban boards), record pages to view individual records and forms to add new records. Noloco provides a totally no-code builder. This genuinely makes building and configuring internal tools 10x faster. With our no-code first approach, Noloco also removes the reliance on engineers whenever your Ops, Customer Support, Product or Sales team want to make any changes or add new tools. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68486&key=user_uploads/567509/8fb689b6-3b51-4d51-8691-67e67803b002) ### **🛠️ What can I build with Noloco?** Customers around the world have built hundreds of internal tools with Noloco for a variety of use cases, including: * Internal tool for your customer support team to update customer plans * CRM to keep customer info up to date and trigger automated workflows * Dashboards to monitor product usage, sign-ups and converted customers * Project management tool for your Ops team ### **⏰ Build your first internal tool in 20 minutes** Most customers find that they can build a functional, useful tool for their teammates to view or update data in their database within 20 minutes.

🚛 Javelin Robotics - Autonomous trucks helping drivers flourish,"Hi 👋 [Addwiteey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/addwiteey-chrungoo-06693320/) and [Sandesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeshgwd/) here to introduce [Javelin Robotics](https://www.javelinrobotics.com/). We help truckers **cut delivery times in half**, doubling productivity and adding much needed capacity to the freight industry. We do this by building autonomy software that tag-teams _with_ human drivers. \\ \\ Conventional trucks drive \\~120K miles/year. Trucks with our tech can hit more than 190K miles/year. Since truckers make money by the mile, this has a direct impact on earnings. Watch [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL_vNhlEzOM). ### **Why should you care?** There is this saying: If its in your home, a truck brought it. Nearly 72% of all freight in America is moved by hard working truckers. 3.5 Million of them. But unfortunately theirs is an ageing pool and not many young folks are joining the workforce. Those who do, frequently quit within a year - a leaky bucket. To add to that, trucks are expected to drive 57% more miles in the coming years to keep up with demand. ### **But aren’t we expecting driverless trucks to solve this?** To some extent yes, but fully driverless long haul solutions has its own constraints, new costs, new risks and require **major** operational changes to how freight is moved today (i.e. point to point, direct to destination). Driverless freight needs to be routed via hubs → 2x stops, 2x handoffs and offers limited operational flexibility / geographical reach. Most small and medium carriers need operational flexibility + geographical reach. So if we look at driverless trucks as a tool, its clear they are necessary, but we need complementary solutions that seamlessly work for most. ### **The solution** Engineer autonomy such that it makes our existing drivers most productive and happy. So, we are building autonomy software that’s designed from the ground up to tag-team _with_ human drivers. We offer our solution as an end-to-end service: autonomous ready freight search, automated driving in service zones, effortless payments. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ohwis2MAaEYhyFZ_A7gxRCUgO6acSak3BzAD5rBNX5T5BDSrnaXTC9vZ9wx9U1AoU0H-rdrt5mfSS5_nxMY0m6f2JWq9UBQApkSzt_TmPPI_1nkfuc6TnjW0JwEa68r6pRSR98LHKrDAu1HHVTRRHrKlhLsj2wArEAh0aZkZfol97pO2knImqZliUBBlPw) For truck drivers, having access to our software is like having access to a **second driver that drives on-demand.** This helps increase: * ⏳ **Productivity** * 🚛 **Trucking capacity** * 💰 **Driver and fleet revenue** ### **How we are different?** We’re _not_ building human-less trucks for a few large carriers. We’re building the **most practical and driver friendly** autonomous system to serve 90% of the trucking industry * Using existing team driving model truckers are familiar with * Delivering both operational flexibility and geographical reach * _No need for_ new infrastructure, process changes or multiple hand-offs * In sync with current US [federal policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/04/04/fact-sheet-the-biden-administrations-unprecedented-actions-to-expand-and-improve-trucking-jobs/) related to trucker jobs * Similar monetary _savings_ for carriers, as driverless. Our tech stack’s architecture leverages advances in modern AI, making our dev 10x more capital efficient. ### **About the founders:** ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/X6gKAXbkWpIjj_XRuOC_kTd3henCDJAnZNraOJGg1v6OfearPdJ1rUGqM9gtReiDo9PzeAnXXMvS6bRr-6ArDK_N4PoUazl5BK2N1pPmuPwiBPHSzKwQT9Grx8wyb2CszzCyR-OrlqQNduBd8WtyaToOy2qBNLjMljgMxw3-Mblqivn7RclfFEcCgOj0QA) [Addwiteey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/addwiteey-chrungoo-06693320/) met [Sandesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandeshgwd/) at Caterpillar where they helped bring the world’s largest autonomous trucks into production. Together, they’ve built autonomous trucks for mines and public highways, from scratch. For them, It's always been about _robots + people_. ### **How you can help:** We would love to chat: * If you or anyone in your network might be interested in learning more or helping out. * If you are a trucker or run a truck co. * If you are a shipper looking to ship faster. **Share this post!** Please help spread the word. _(many truckers don’t realize autonomy can actually help)._ We can be reached at [founders@javelinrobotics.com](mailto:founders@javelinrobotics.com)",Addwiteey Chrungoo,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/07d8317729e2105444fe7d242c87f0898611f6e2.jpg,,22785
📱💊 Sanvivo - DoorDash for pharmacies,"⏰ TL;DR With our mobile app, [VIVOLY](https://onelink.to/vivolylaunchyc), patients can easily order medication and get them delivered to their doorstep in just 120 minutes. \\ **❌ The problem – buying medication in Europe is inconvenient**\\ For patients: * Medicine is often out of stock * Long waiting times of up to 24h when buying medication * Medication can be purchased at mail-order-pharmacies, but shipping takes several days For local pharmacies * Pharmacies are barely using digital tools * Orders (if any) are operated using paper notes or fax * Pharmacies can not scale (cap of 4 - 6 pharmacies per owner in Europe) * No digital tools to improve customer loyalty & retention \\ **📈 The European pharmaceutical market is changing rapidly** * Telemedicine is expected to grow by 300% by 2027 * E-prescription unlocks the market for a new digital patient journey * Pharmacies in Germany are already doing 120M deliveries a year without any digital tools. \\ **✨ Our Solution**\\ With our mobile app, [VIVOLY](https://onelink.to/vivolylaunchyc), patients can easily order medication and get them delivered to their doorstep in just 120 minutes. Local pharmacies receive these orders in their Point-of-Sale (POS) systems and communicate with the patient via chat. Vivoly is beneficial, especially for patients with difficulty leaving their homes due to mobility issues or underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infection. The risk of transmission is reduced by allowing patients to order medications online and deliver them directly to their doorstep. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1159560/c176ffba-7dc7-42f1-a4f0-857fec190e86) \\ **⚙ How it works**\\ In most European countries, franchising is not allowed for pharmacies. Just like individual restaurants, pharmacies in Europe are one-person businesses. Without any state-of-the-art e-commerce solutions, it is tough for local pharmacies to compete with mail-order-pharmacies. This is true even though local pharmacies offer a much faster patient supply. In Germany alone, there are over 120M deliveries done per year by pharmacies. Those are done without any digital process and are managed mostly manually. Compared to most retailers, pharmacies typically have real-time inventory management. Sanvivo builds a marketplace that unlocks this existing infrastructure and delivery capabilities to enable a fast “quick-commerce” user experience. With our App, [VIVOLY,](https://onelink.to/vivolylaunchyc) patients order medication and get pharmaceutical advice via chat. Pharmacies are enabled to process those orders through our web app. Then, ready-to-pick-up orders are delivered by riders of the pharmacy using our mobile rider app. \\ **🙏 Asks** * Download our app (currently only in Germany) and share your feedback with us ([founders@sanvivo.eu](mailto:founders@sanvivo.eu)) ### [Download VIVOLY App](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1634607276?pt=125264050&ct=bookfacee&mt=8) * If you know great **working students** with coding, online marketing, or sales skills, please let us know. * **We are open to connecting** and cooperating with health providers.",Julius Rachor,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/bfd4569ce1acf5ad0a1426c03f968a78d9dcf0db.jpg,Otherimage_28018_1.jpg;,28018
🍽️ Baseplate - Optimize your LLM’s with Deeper Insights,"Baseplate is a no-code platform for fine tuning, monitoring, and managing Large Language Models. We analyze your prompts & training data, test your model, and provide deep insights to help you get the most out of LLMs without the hassle.  **The Problem** Large Language Models like GPT-3 are all the rage right now, but they remain a black box that can be difficult to understand for developers and users. What prompts work best? What level of detail do I need to provide? What temperature setting should I use? How are users liking the results? How is my current model performing versus others? For most teams, answering these questions about their models is a tedious, expensive, and time consuming process that requires manual testing and prayers. That’s where Baseplate comes in. **LLMs with Baseplate** Our platform takes all of the hard parts of making your LLM production ready, and makes it extremely simple. Baseplate allows you to fine tune models, create test data sets, test your model, collect user feedback for model reinforcement, and deploy your model from a no-code interface. We currently support all of OpenAI’s language models with planned integrations for Cohere, Anthropic, and AI21 Labs.

📃 Common Paper - Faster sales with standard contracts & structured data 📃,"TLDR: If you want to close deals faster/shorten your sales cycles with standardized contracts and a platform that helps eliminate back and forth, [we’d love for you to try us out](https://commonpaper.com/)! # Background We (Jake and Ben) met while working together at a BI startup called RJMetrics. Jake was a co-founder, and Ben was an engineering leader. At that job and others, we were incredibly **frustrated by contract negotiation**. The process was filled with: * **⏳ Unpredictable delays** * **💰 Huge legal bills** * **🥽 Extremely limited visibility** We realized that founders and go-to-market teams have many of the same problems with sales that were widespread in startup fundraising before the introduction of the SAFE. Each company has a unique sales or procurement contract (and NDA, DPA, etc).  People argue over whose template to use, and **no matter who wins that argument, one side of the deal has to review and negotiate a new contract for the first time**. The same basic ideas show up in all contracts about a given type of transaction, but they are expressed totally differently.  As an example, take governing law, one of the simplest terms in most contracts.  These are real examples from four contracts, showing four different ways describe governing law: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/71220/b869c8db-5099-478e-855d-b34c5b28bf55) # Standard Contracts & Structured Data To solve this, we looked to the SAFE and other widely used contracts for inspiration and created standard, open-source contracts for buying and selling software, including: * [Design Partner Agreement](https://commonpaper.com/standards/design-partner-agreement/) * [Mutual NDA](https://commonpaper.com/standards/mutual-nda/) * [Terms of Service](https://commonpaper.com/standards/terms-of-service/) * [Cloud Service Agreement](https://commonpaper.com/standards/cloud-service-agreement/)  * [Data Processing Agreement](https://commonpaper.com/standards/data-processing-agreement/), [Service Level Agreement](https://commonpaper.com/standards/service-level-agreement/), and more These contracts have been downloaded by thousands of companies, are created by a committee of attorneys, and are free to use under a Creative Commons license.  ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/71220/bc9fd4c5-56c8-48ed-8ab2-dd024fa5b974) Using standard contracts reduces back and forth, accelerates sales cycles, and makes it easier for everyone involved to understand what the contracts actually mean. In addition to the contracts themselves, we’ve built a new kind of [contract management platform](https://commonpaper.com/product/) for startups.  It makes automation, negotiation, and programmatic access to contract data all way faster and easier than ever before. These kinds of tools have traditionally been built for managing unstructured text, and we’ve built Common Paper on top of the **standards and structured data**.  **⌚ 63% of the deals on our platform close within 24 hours ⏲️** We also built the [SaaS Agreement Toolkit](https://commonpaper.com/resources/saas-agreement-toolkit), which combines the standard agreements with step by step guides to help founders: * Choose which contracts to use based on their stage and business model * Understand the meaning of different terms within the contracts The toolkit also includes a benchmark report based on the real contracts of more than 150 companies, with data on what positions are most common and how different terms influence the odds of getting your contract signed. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/71220/b4ae10b3-d5bf-4439-b700-df82cb92e521) If you want to shorten your sales cycle, save money, and reduce risk with standardized contracts and a platform that helps eliminate back and forth, [we’d love for you to try us out](https://commonpaper.com/)!",Jake Stein,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/fe4eced33a0dc54b656cc2b6bcf6ac89f87d8730.jpg,Otherimage_28093_1.jpg;Otherimage_28093_2.jpg;Otherimage_28093_3.jpg;,28093

This is because SaaS founders and product managers spend most of their time on improving their core product. Insights features are rarely top-of-mind, even though they increase user stickiness. Most teams tell themselves that they will eventually get to it. But they rarely do. The result is a hastily-built dashboard that provides limited insights to users. ### 🎉 **Our solution** We make it super easy to let your users ask questions in natural language and instantly get data and insights on your app. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1153841/bd2e56ef-b1f8-4d38-b02a-1c851549def9) Defog embeds an intuitive Q&A-style interface for analytics in your app, and lets users query data in seconds. Some examples of how companies can use Defog: * Fintech companies could provide deep insights based on users’ transaction history. * Video meeting tools could extract common complaints across customer calls and make them easy to discover. * Social media platforms could replace generic analytics dashboards with more specific metrics. ### **🪄 How it works** 1. Give us the metadata of your database schema (if using SQL), or just unstructured data corpuses (if using APIs or text corpuses) 2. Add our iframe or Javascript plugin to your app 3. (optional) set up visual styling for how charts should look on our app 4. Let your users ask questions of the data, and get insights in seconds We’re powered by large language models that can search and visualise both structured data (like SQL databases or data warehouses) and unstructured data (like text in call transcripts).

Supercool: The easiest way to buy NFTs,"# TL;DR At Supercool, we help NFT sellers set up the simplest NFT checkout experience that enables anyone to seamlessly purchase NFTs using their email and a credit card. No wallet or crypto required! ### **The Problem** Whether you are crypto-native or new to web3, buying NFTs can be nerve-racking. Only the steps required to have a crypto wallet are enough to prevent anyone from purchasing NFTs. First time buyers have to setup a crypto wallet, which involves downloading Chrome extensions and storing long pass phrases; then they have to figure out how to buy crypto currency from an exchange and go through several KYC steps in the process; finally, they need to send crypto from the exchange to their wallet, connect their wallet to the mint website, and sign the transactions required for the purchase. These are way too many steps and can take days to complete! Because doing simple things in web3 often requires so many steps, web3 has become an exclusive club of decentralization and tech enthusiasts — but it shouldn’t be this way; everyone should be able to participate. ### **Simplifying the NFT checkout** In order to onboard more people into the NFT space and capture larger audiences, we need to offer users a purchasing experience as seamless as what already exists in e-commerce: **secure** **payments using credit cards**.

Radical ✈️ Wireless connectivity from the stratosphere,"Hi [👋](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand/#:\\~:text=A%20hand%20waving%20most%20commonly,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.) [James](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james0thomas/) and [Cyriel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyriel-notteboom/) here to introduce [Radical](https://www.radicalaero.com/)! Radical makes internet access affordable worldwide. We are building high altitude solar aircraft to deliver broadband connectivity at a fraction of the cost of terrestrial networks. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1045182/65f89115-af17-4432-ae79-3fcbeb7b2bc5) ### **The Problem: Universal Connectivity** More than 3 billion people lack access to reliable broadband internet. Bringing underserved communities online is difficult with existing technologies. * Terrestrial networks are prohibitively expensive to establish in sparsely populated areas, and signal quality can be impaired in areas with hilly terrain. * Satellite networks are also costly, they require rocket launches and large constellations to achieve consistent coverage. Additionally, these services are not mobile - requiring the end user to use a dish transceiver. * High altitude balloons are unable to maintain position in strong winds and can drift away from their target service areas. ### **The Solution: Radical’s Stratospheric Aircraft** The ideal cell tower is positioned near users, but away from the ground to maintain line-of-sight coverage over a large service area. Radical is building the ideal cell tower: a high altitude solar aircraft. * Unlike terrestrial cell towers, high altitude aircraft maintain line-of-sight coverage over a large area and avoid terrain obstructions. * High altitude aircraft are 20x closer to the ground than low earth orbit satellites, reducing latency and eliminating the need for dish transceivers. * Unlike balloons, high altitude aircraft are able to maintain position in strong winds. All together, this means we can establish coverage in areas that were previously uneconomical to service. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1045182/893208ea-fa0f-46bc-9dc7-b93042439b94) ### **How it works** Radical’s aircraft flies in the lower stratosphere - above weather, clouds, and aviation traffic. Here it collects solar energy from the sun in the day, and deploys battery energy at night - allowing it to fly continuously year-round. The aircraft has the wingspan of a passenger jet, but is ultra-light and ultra-efficient, weighing less than a motorbike and using the same amount of power as a hair dryer. ### **Ask** If you know telecommunications companies that are interested in improving their network coverage, we’d like to be connected!",James Thomas,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0b7c185c49f67aa098d46078a656757ddd68860c.jpg,Otherimage_27960_1.jpg;Otherimage_27960_2.jpg;,27960

It can feel strange and painful in your new body. Too many postpartum workout and wellness programs rush you, or put your body at risk—and many are not evidence-based.\\ \\ How do you begin to regain strength, support the pelvic floor, and heal your core—without ever having to leave home or go to a clinic?  ### **Who is Ready by Ruth Health for?** We simplify the process with 6 weeks of initial content and more to come.

NYC has the highest maternal mortality rate of any major city in the developed world. Moms, parents, and even their non-birthing partners need us. Nobody should have to suffer alone, in silence, or without affordable, attainable help. Incontinence after birth may be normal, but it’s not “okay.” We’ve had ENOUGH. We’re the women building women’s healthcare for us, by us. Women deserve better ✊🏿✊🏽✊🏼 we make care better for every body. ### **How can I help?** **1.

Think of it like an electric flying jet ski, that is super bad ass. The complete overhaul that the 50 year old Jetski desperately needs. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68006&key=user_uploads/159353/1b753dae-0030-4a9a-90b6-055292666ef0) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68006&key=user_uploads/159353/a5b48647-e421-4c01-8254-99b09d61e6e2) **📉The old - Jetskis** Loud, gas-burning, noisy impeller driven, wake causing, wave splashing bathtubs. **📈The new -** [**_Valo_**](https://ridevalo.com/) A fully electric, near silent, near zero wake, high speed, highly agile vehicle that slices above the waves. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68006&key=user_uploads/159353/6eaeca7e-206f-4368-8a7f-fc6298be1c01) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68006&key=user_uploads/159353/323c9876-4d67-4d88-bb74-178cb0e6e80d) ### **📋 Specs:** * Top speed: 58 mph * Range: 68 miles * Charging time: 3 hours * Cruising altitude: 2 ft * 100% electric * Hull: Carbon Fiber ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68006&key=user_uploads/159353/de88bd84-ff5b-45b1-ae7b-c0d690d77872) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68006&key=user_uploads/159353/d1aa3612-35cd-459e-8604-0c7c09de6698) ### 🤔 **Why do I want one?** Riding Valo is truly exhilarating, flying clear above the surface of the water, banking into turns like a ski racer. You don't get wet. You don't need good balance. Cruise from the SF Marina to Sausalito in 10 minutes. Have a cocktail, enjoy the sun. All without making waves, noise, or emissions. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=68006&key=user_uploads/159353/53404302-f851-49cf-87ab-42418c643755) ### **🔨Who is making it?** Our team consists of world class engineers that have worked on Americas Cup racing yachts, hyperloops, self landing rockets, and navy ships, as well as having a massive amount of experience in making electric foiling boats. We are super confident that Valo will work better than we have planned and that customers will absolutely love it. We are going to use the technology in Valo to revolutionize increasingly larger boats and ships, ultimately bringing zero emissions technology to the entire marine sector. ### **📦How do I get one?** [Place a reservation today!](https://ridevalo.com/) $1000 fully refundable. A reservation secures your spot in the line for the limited production slots we will have available next year. ### **📆When will it be ready?** We will have a prototype complete by early Feb next year, and will be offering demo rides. We will then have a limited run of founders edition vessels delivered mid next year, with priority given to the reservation queue position. The full production run will begin early after that. ### **🎣How much does it cost?** Valo costs more than your typical jet ski. Production price is targeted at $59,000. This is because Jetski’s and PWCs in general are pretty much glorified fiberglass bathtubs with a piston engines slapped inside. Valo is effectively a fully featured electric aircraft with wings, stabilizers, actuated control surfaces, inertial sensors and complex flight control software, nothing else out there comes close to it, and all that extra stuff does add to the cost.\\ \\ If you have any questions, reach out to [valo@boundarylayer.tech](mailto:valo@boundarylayer.tech) ### **Thanks!**",Ed Kearney,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c0456becfa096417aaaddb243f2e252f9a6eae00.jpg,Otherimage_12083_1.jpg;Otherimage_12083_2.jpg;Otherimage_12083_3.jpg;Otherimage_12083_4.jpg;Otherimage_12083_5.jpg;Otherimage_12083_6.jpg;Otherimage_12083_7.jpg;Otherimage_12083_8.jpg;,12083

🔍 Keyval - Distributed traces for every application without code changes,"Hi YC! We're Ari and Eden, the founders of [Keyval](https://keyval.dev/).\\ Odigos, our open-source project, boosts your existing monitoring tools by automatically generating distributed traces for all your applications within minutes. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67880&key=user_uploads/171492/8220e796-3f4d-456f-9040-8e69c20591f0) Check out our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9d36AmVtuGU) ### **The Problem** Distributed traces are the most effective signal to monitor distributed applications, but they are also the most difficult to implement.  Unlike metrics or logs, the real value of distributed tracing occurs only after implementing it across multiple applications successfully.  If just one of your applications does not produce distributed tracing, the entire context propagation is broken and the value of the traces drops significantly. ### **The Solution** Odigos, our open-source project, helps developers fix production issues faster by boosting existing monitoring tools, and automatically providing them with distributed traces, within minutes. A quick installation scans and recognizes all your applications, auto-instruments them, and deploys the required collectors. This is all done automatically - all you need to do is: 1. Select your target applications 2. Select a backend you want to send the information to That’s it! ### **Why developers choose to work with Odigos:** ✨ **Immediately and automatically** get distributed traces for newly-deployed application\\ 🏆 **Eliminate blind spots**! Gain confidence and understand what is (and what isn’t) covered by your existing monitoring tools\\ 🚀 **Ease of use** – one-step installation completed within minutes\\ **⚖️ Auto-scaled collectors/agents** - deployed and scaled according to the amount of traffic generated by your applications ### **Try it yourself** Check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/keyval-dev/odigos), and our [getting started guide](https://odigos.io/docs/getting-started/). We are also maintainers of OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for Go applications. Feel free to contact us at [founders@keyval.dev](mailto:founders@keyval.dev) with any questions regarding monitoring / eBPF / OpenTelemetry.

Our mission is to democratize robots. [Orangewood’s](https://orangewood.co/) robots are safe, easy to operate, affordable, and capable of handling modern-day manufacturing challenges. **The Problem** Small businesses don’t have access to automation and are suffering because of it. The cost of the industry standard robotic arm is $35,000 without integration - and assuming that you need multiple robotic arms for any given function - this adds up very quickly.

Our robotic arms aren’t nearly as accurate as the industry leader, but that’s okay! Not every task requires 100% accuracy. We’re currently focusing on industrial applications like pick-and-place, spray painting, and welding.

🏗️ Pirros - Detail Management System for Construction Designers,"Hey YC! We're Ari and Peter, co-founders of Pirros. Pirros is a detail management system for structural engineers and architects. Our goal is to make it easier to use the knowledge from previous projects to save time on future projects. ### 😬 **The Problem** Construction design companies (structural engineering and architectural firms) are wasting time redesigning the same detailing conditions. \""Details\"" are the micro-level blueprints of a construction building, for example a beam to column connection, or a wall assembly (see below). Each construction project has 100s of details, half of which are recreated for each project. 90% of these detailing conditions have been encountered and designed on one of the company's previous projects, the designer just doesn't have easy access to them. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67836&key=user_uploads/1099489/4cc5fe6a-4748-482f-b0a0-2928c858a807) #### ✅ **Our Solution** On our platform, companies store the details from all their previous projects in a single cloud-based location (see below). Now, engineers and architects can quickly access any detailing condition just as easily as a google search, instead digging through all their past projects on their file server looking for a needle in a haystack. ![](https://t36258466.p.clickup-attachments.com/t36258466/cc2dcd32-cf02-4184-ae29-8275e69fa288/Website.png) #### ⚒️ **How it works** Our software integrates with Revit (the industry standard drawing production software), and extracts each detail and all the metadata associated with it, so that there is enough information automatically stored with each detail to make them searchable. Designers come to our website, search and filter down to find the detailing condition they need for their current project, and then download the detail straight into Revit. #### 🙏 **The Ask** We are continuing to onboard new customers and would love warm intros to structural engineers or architects. Or, if YOU are a structural engineer or architect, please reach out to us and we would love to set up a demo. Thanks!",Peter Johann,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/db7c5257a3243d8ba0a6a9ab9264f6e01ae2527c.jpg,Otherimage_27837_1.jpg;,27837
🏄 SensorSurf - Data infra for robotics,"> **tl;dr:** Robots produce a lot of data, and it’s a challenge to collect and manage all of it. Our infrastructure enables companies to easily collect, offload, and make use of sensor data. > > ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67785&key=user_uploads/1161431/6669487c-0baf-4116-b0b7-1dd6b0ba7ec6) --- Howdy, YC! I’m [Alec Bell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alec-bell/) from SensorSurf. I love robots, and I’m writing software to make it easier to build them. ### **❌** Problem Robots generate absurd quantities of data. **A single self-driving car produces up to 1.5 petabytes/year** ([source](https://www.tuxera.com/blog/autonomous-cars-300-tb-of-data-per-year/)). Developers need access to this data to diagnose issues, train models, and run simulations; but it’s hard to get a hold of since its clunky and sits on an edge device. Robotics companies currently build data infra in-house, which is extremely costly. ### ✅ Solution **SensorSurf offers the infrastructure to collect, offload, and make use of sensor data.** Users can specify where, when, and what data to collect. From there, they can selectively offload it, run queries on it, visualize it, and put it to work for purposes like debugging, annotation, and analytics. ### 👨‍💻 How it works Robotics companies install **a tiny agent on their robots,** which allows us to establish a connection to our services and **observe their system.** We can then collect data across a fleet of robots and help users manage/search it in the cloud, accounting for network constraints that our customers may experience. ### 👍 Noteworthy features * [Event-based data collection](https://docs.woeden.com/collection/auto_record) * [Rolling buffers/windows of data](https://docs.woeden.com/collection/rolling_buffer) * [Data streaming for visualization](https://docs.woeden.com/management/visualize) ### 🙏 Asks * **Robotics developers:** [**try out our tool**](https://docs.woeden.com/getting_started)**!** * Share this post to robotics communities. * Connect us with robotics companies and researchers ([founders@woeden.com](mailto:founders@woeden.com)).",Alec Bell,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/94b6326f6f22998fe0145ea5eb2000be053a194e.jpg,Otherimage_27942_1.jpg;,27942
Happl - Set up global benefits and recognition in seconds 🌍📦⚡,"TL;DR: Happl saves you time and money all whilst managing all of your people engagement and recognition initiatives. For leaders, we handle flexible benefits, allowances, insurance, and manager-to-employee gifting, all whilst ensuring you’re staying compliant. For employees, we use benefits as communities within your existing stack to engage, as well as understand them on a personal and inclusive level through interests and goals. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67761&key=user_uploads/401900/adb698a0-abe5-447b-a433-7efa64ed283e) **🤯 The problem** Employees are not offered personal and inclusive benefits that have an impact, resulting in poor uptake, whilst often founders aren’t sure how to engage their global teams effectively. Companies often roll out company-wide benefits such as a meditation app, or learning platform, in the hope that it’s going to magnificently fix their engagement and retention problems. We hate to break it to you, but that isn’t cutting it. **Our solution? Flip traditional benefits on their head ⬇️** * Flexible spend allowances, with controls and international support * A marketplace fo recommendations and discounts of quality over quantity * Community benefits, connect over shared benefits within slack * Personal and inclusive employee profiles for impactful recommendations * Manager engagement budgets with prompts and reminders for employee gifting ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67761&key=user_uploads/401900/e2d3eb7b-274d-433d-8e17-b3c4c4d9dc14) **Who’s it for? 🌍** We know what it’s like firsthand to scale a company with the weight of ensuring your team is engaged, and it’s not easy. Many of our users, who we like to call Happling’s (we’re working on that) have employees in many regions and simply want to consolidate their benefit allowance and roll it out with ease. Others want to make sure they’re getting the best prices and save money through benchmarking. We support start-ups from 5 employees or more, all the way through to more mature companies with thousands of employees like Google, NatWest Bank, The Metropolitan Police, and more. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67761&key=user_uploads/401900/68a6073b-3a03-4904-931c-1b839f8f041c) **How it works 💡** We handle everything from the get-go, with a speedy onboarding process through connecting with your HRIS and Accounting software. Rolling out spend allowances or manager expense cards is as simple as choosing an amount. We automatically detect multiple locations and convert the allowances so it’s fair for all employees. Employees can sign up with SSO and curate a profile that's personal and inclusive to them. We can share this information with managers prior to gifting or organising a team event to engage. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67761&key=user_uploads/401900/91d47b14-2cea-4925-8b3e-8cf5127451c0) **How to get on it 🖥️** Take advantage of our YC Deal email me at [ben@happl.com](mailto:ben@happl.com) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67761&key=user_uploads/401900/07b30ce0-15a9-4a7e-badc-30b4dbfead31)",Ben Towers,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/fd1ea9a12ae728c8e07d841a634eb74dbd3a848b.jpg,Otherimage_25521_1.jpg;Otherimage_25521_2.jpg;Otherimage_25521_3.jpg;Otherimage_25521_4.jpg;Otherimage_25521_5.jpg;,25521

🐝 Wasp Beta - Develop full-stack web apps in React & Node.js without boilerplate,"Hey developers! 👋 We’re Martin and Matija, founders of Wasp - we’re super excited to be here today! Our last big launch was one and a half years ago - since then a lot happened and **we’re proud to present Wasp Beta!** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/109403/0ed916ef-e2e5-4cd4-8241-f9702617e45e) ### **⚡️TL;DR** **Wasp is the fastest way to develop full-stack web apps in React & Node.js**. Describe high-level features (auth, CRUD, async jobs, …) via a simple config language, and write the rest of your logic in React, Node.js and Prisma. With the Beta release, we also [**announced our first hackathon**](https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev/) - make sure to join, have fun, and win cool prizes! (hint: wasp-themed mechanical keyboard 🐝 ⌨️) You can see the 4-min demo video [here](https://youtu.be/eVXbctXquK4). ### **🐝 🐝 The team** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/109403/49bc358b-14d3-4385-b593-f1b175a0795a) This is us at our first retreat in Croatia (Vince, our devrel, who joined shortly after, expertly photoshopped in :D)!\\ We’re a distributed team of engineers and web development & programming language aficionados. Having worked at some of the world’s largest companies and startups, we experienced the problem we’re solving at various stages. ### 💡 **What is Wasp?** **You can think of Wasp as a full-stack web framework for React & Node.js**. We solve the common problems you face when you start developing a web app - choosing all the parts of the stack, figuring out how to stitch them together in the best way, adding auth, running cron jobs, ... Wasp also makes it super easy to work with and sync data models across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, database). You don't even have to define and deal with any kind of CRUD API - Wasp will do that for you under the hood. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/109403/7e32a672-dec6-4f31-9fa7-1c9c35de2545) ### 🦉 **Who is it for?** Speaking to developers we realized many of them just want to build, and they’ll use whichever tool helps them best achieve their goals. They don’t care that the library being used for making HTTP requests is 2kb bigger and builds 10ms slower than some new alternative. They just want to be sure they have all the best practices in place and that their choices won't come back to haunt them once their project grows. If you can relate to that, then Wasp is for you. We know there are plenty of great solutions for developers today (frameworks, BaaS-es, code scaffolders, ...) but Wasp is probably the fastest one to get started with, and with the least amount of code. ### 🍜 **What's the secret sauce?** The main reason for that is Wasp's unique twist on web frameworks - a config language (DSL) that works alongside your React & Node.js code. It allowed us to **drastically reduce the amount of boilerplate and simplify the developer experience**. For example, full-stack authentication with both user/pass and Google methods takes only 8 lines of code. In the future, the language approach could enable us to do some really exciting things such as supporting multiple frameworks and languages (even at the same time) and having full control over the generated code, introducing optimizations, etc. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/109403/d712d053-1786-4d31-af06-cc773c00444f) Wasp now has its own language server - that means auto-completion, live error reporting, … 🏘 **What can I build with Wasp?** Pretty much any web app with a database! Anything you'd build with React & Node.js by themselves you can build with Wasp. Think SaaS, side projects, internal tools, hackathons, ... To see what others are building with Wasp, take a look here: [Wasp showcase gallery](https://wasp-lang.dev/#showcases) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/109403/8cf380fa-522b-470a-bbf9-95b3f0201034) With the intro out of the way, let's see what's new in Beta: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/109403/702a317f-f8e9-446e-b8f1-46f59e95cb5d) 🔑 **Full-stack auth**\\ Log in with your username & password or via Google! Other providers are also coming soon. 🟦 **TypeScript support** \\ Write your code in TypeScript, both on the client and server! We're also migrating our whole codebase and adding new types every day. 💨 **Tailwind support**\\ Just add two config files and you are ready to use Tailwind in your project! ⏳ **Running Async Jobs**\\ Send emails, crunch data every night and build reports or anything that shouldn't be a part of a typical request-response cycle. Powered by pg-boss, zero setup required. 🥛 **Optimistic updates support** Wasp will by default propagate your data model changes across the stack. Still, [in some cases](https://wasp-lang.dev/blog/2021/12/02/waspello#what-doesnt-work-yet), you might want more control over that flow for the sake of smoother UX - that is now easy to achieve with Wasp! 📟 **Wasp Language Server**\\ Wasp now has its own LSP for VS Code (other editors coming soon)! That means improved syntax highlighting, code snippets, autocompletion, and error reporting. Everything you'd expect from a language! ### **🙌 Our ask** * Try Wasp out & let us know your feedback - **join our Discord**! * J[oin our Beta hackathon - Betathon](https://betathon.wasp-lang.dev/)!

Enveloop - Build and send messages with a single API.,"Hey, we’re Ben and Jason! (S11 / W20) We’re announcing [**Enveloop**](https://enveloop.com) — a developer-focused **message builder** and **API** that makes it easy to design & send beautiful emails and texts from your app using one simple implementation. And you don’t have to be a designer — we’re focused on making developers look awesome. 🤩 ### **📣 Why We Built Enveloop** Developers create apps. Apps need to talk to users. Simple, right? Unfortunately — multiple APIs, maintaining message content, design standards, delivery standards, handling failure/retry -- you have to figure it all out, and, over time, **it all becomes scattered in your code.** _Worse_ — the content is inaccessible to those that need to edit it because it’s mixed with the design & implementation — buried in your code with all that other complexity. That puts **you** in the middle of any update, big or small. Gross. We’ve built a graceful service that solves this. It’s simple for developers, collaborative for consultants and their clients, and ready for fast-moving product & development teams. **It’s Enveloop.** ### **💪 Our Solution** With Enveloop, we offer developers: * A powerful & friendly-to-use message builder. * Loads of elegantly-designed templates to get you started quickly. * Intuitive formatting built with developers in mind (markdown, mustache, etc.) * A single API that supports multiple message types and providers. * Easy delegation of message content to others on your team (or to your clients!) All this helps to **remove unnecessary code/complexity** from your app and **reduces superficial deployments**. And more is on the way, including support for additional message types and useful message analytics. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/24221/8b766f45-e4c3-4014-ac55-1c5b6cd8d23d) ### **🙏 Our Ask** We would love to have you try out **Enveloop**!

🦷 Rinse - Building the One Medical for dental,"**TL;DR:** Rinse marries tech and hospitality to make routine mouth care easy, awesome, and way more effective. We’re just a few days away from opening our first location at 1763 Union St. San Francisco ([map](https://goo.gl/maps/JcPoM1wDaGX6FAma8)). You can now book instantly [online](https://rinse.page.link/aL7u) or in the Rinse [iOS app](https://rinse.page.link/vyJw)! Hello 👋 I’m [Casey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseyharlin/), the founder of [Rinse](https://rinse.page.link/aL7u). I’m an engineer turned healthcare exec that spent 8 years leading product at Delta Dental, the world’s largest Dental insurance company. ### **The problem… Going to the dentist sucks 😩** Your typical dental office offers inconvenient hours, antiquated tech, and a vibe straight out of the 90s. Likewise, with [little to no standard of care in dentistry](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/05/the-trouble-with-dentistry/586039/), we can only hope we’ve found an honest dentist who will focus on preventing, even reversing disease, not succumb to the perverse incentives of an industry optimized for ‘drilling, filling, and billing’. **The result…** 2 in 3 adults simply do not go to the dentist. A cycle of which leads to systemic oral health issues known to impact your overall health, confidence, and ultimately lead to costly (and painful) procedures we’d all rather avoid. ### **Rinse makes it easy to get great mouth care 🙌** We’re a technology enabled dental studio designed to make your routine mouth care easy, awesome, and way more effective! ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/691376/e44970f8-c696-4c87-829a-0783691aec6d) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/691376/51e5395c-3bb9-47ab-b0ad-934ef2e0f95b) ### **Our Ask 🙏** 1.

Milestones - Keep clients in the know.,"We’re Milestones, and we’re building the bridge between businesses CRM and their clients.  In 2018, Co-Founder, Manny’s wife, was in a car accident on her way to work. The injuries she suffered put her out of work for a few weeks and caused emotional trauma, so she decided to hire a lawyer to get her compensation. During the course of her legal case, she never felt like she was kept in the loop. She didn’t understand the process and always wanted more information. When a client wants more info should they always have to reach out? Do you text Amazon to ask them where your package is at? No! We believe you shouldn’t have to text a business to see where your project is at either. ### **❌ A Two-Sided Problem** * **Clients:** In today's day and age it's typical to have all the information we want at our fingertips. Clients get frustrated because they want to know what is being worked on and what comes next. * **Businesses:** Businesses are often much too busy to keep clients updated with every phase of their project. Businesses often store a wealth of information in their software, but that information is never communicated/available to clients. ### **🧪 Solution** Think about your interactions with various businesses: * Insurance claims * Taxes * Getting a loan * Building a house * Legal cases * Oil changes * Solar Installations * etc. How much better would it be if there was a _Domino's Pizza Tracker-esque_ interface for each one? * Milestones connects directly with a business’s CRM to automate updates and stream information back and forth. Notifications are sent to clients via text message, so that a client has easy access to the information. Clients enter the milestones application through a link in the text message. Clients and businesses can communicate back and forth through the Milestones application. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=67468&key=user_uploads/916405/aafd64e0-bdb2-4d9d-8b05-5eb245efdf5a) ### **⚙️ How it works** * Using API’s, a business can set up which information they want to be pushed back and forth to clients. That information includes: * Status Updates * Documents * Educational information * Calendared Events * Team Information * Etc. * Clients use SMS and the Milestones app to interact with the business.   ### **🙏 How to help:** 1.

We’re on a mission to make using and working with APIs **super easy.** ### **🤦 The problem** There are two major headaches we’re tackling: * Slow APIs dramatically reduce the speed of your site, and adding caching to solve this can be hard * Debugging API issues is painful. You want full visibility of requests and responses so you can figure out what’s going on, during development and production (although we make production logging optional) ### **🦸 With API Hero, you can:** * Monitor all your API traffic (or just the parts you want) * Speed up every API you use by enabling caching (this can also save you money!) * Get alerts when issues arise * Improve reliability with automatic retries ### **🛠 How does API Hero work?** * Login to [API Hero](https://apihero.run/) (it’s free!) * Follow the simple onboarding steps – we’ll automatically populate your dashboard as soon as a request is sent * Configure the settings to proxy only the traffic you want * Sit back and watch those logs come in! ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1093162/90670a20-df63-4740-af17-46c35e850deb) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1093162/ed99841e-bcd2-411c-94ac-6298c3a28d78) ### **💬 We’d love to chat to:** * Anyone suffering from API issues * Any company working with 3rd-party APIs or building APIs * Anyone who’s checked out API Hero and has feedback",James Ritchie,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/cdb66f5159b7a5dd2f8b585aeaf1fa06421ba150.jpg,Otherimage_27680_1.jpg;Otherimage_27680_2.jpg;,27680

doola Company Formation API 🔮,"Hey everyone! 👋 We’re excited to open our [Company Formation API](https://www.doola.com/company-formation-api?utm_source=launchyc&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=formationapi) up to the YC community. 🥳 At doola, our mission is to help anyone turn their dream idea into their dream US business from anywhere in the world. To enable this for founders meant handling all the complex paperwork — something we spent hours manually filing forms with the state and IRS. There had to be a better way. So we built a Formation API in-house. Today, we can file companies with the state in minutes upon receiving information from a founder. And we can do this for founders, 100% remotely, from anywhere in the world. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/306058/5cf78b55-cc08-4719-96e1-e41eb621a5c8) The API we have built can now empower businesses of all types and sizes to offer US company formation and ongoing compliance at scale, fully powered by doola.

Dots - 🤖 no-code bot builder for Discord,"We’re Sanket and Pranav, co-founders of [Dots](https://dots.community/?utm_source=launchyc). Dots helps community teams support and engage their Discord communities through automation and member insights. **😩 Problem:** We have built communities in the past, and often we saw a ton of repetitive manual work required to build a great community. Community leads spend hours kicking bots/toxic members or answering FAQs, leading to burn out.

📲 📈 Rollouts by Runway,"# A single source of truth for mobile release health, instantly understandable – and actionable As former mobile engineers ourselves, the Runway team and I have experienced the challenge of rollouts firsthand  — and now, we’ve built something that can help. We’re excited to announce [_Rollouts_](https://www.runway.team/blog/introducing-rollouts-by-runway), a new part of the Runway platform that helps your team navigate rollouts with less collective stress, and more confidence. _Rollouts_ allows you to easily keep tabs on release health in just one place instead of many, alerts you whenever configured metrics become unhealthy, and safeguards release health by automatically halting rollouts based on thresholds you define. # What is _Rollouts_? Here are some highlights: ### 🗺 The only complete picture of release health Rollouts integrates with the mix of different tools you use to measure app health – crash reporting, observability & product analytics, the app stores (for per-version user ratings) – to create a single source of truth and unified dashboard that gives your team a holistic and instantly understandable view of release health at a glance. No more context-switching, no more mental overhead. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/562880/098822f9-93e6-4ac4-a612-c13ce50f187e) ### 🌡 You define exactly what “healthy” means for your team Across all tools and every metric, you can configure granular thresholds that together define what “healthy” looks like for your team. Runway will surface a crystal clear view of how each release is tracking relative to that definition. With expectations around health codified this way, there’s no room for ambiguity or hand-waving when it comes to your team’s standards for quality of the product you’re shipping. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/562880/479df881-d88e-4e1e-9cc2-d4ac27941bc4) ### 🚨 Avoid blind spots and delays with instant alerting The moment any of your configured metrics become unhealthy during a rollout, Runway will alert your team, in specific channels of your choosing and with full context on which metrics are problematic. You can be confident that no bad trends will go unnoticed – and that they can be acted on more quickly. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/562880/115d18e8-0167-47e6-8ce4-630bed0f564a) ### 🛑 Automatically halt unhealthy rollouts Building on the custom thresholds you define, Runway can automatically halt unhealthy releases. With this automation enabled, if certain metrics of your choosing fall afoul of your acceptable thresholds during a rollout, Runway will automatically stop the rollout and alert your team. This prevents delays and human error, saving you from the negative consequences of a bad release making it out to even more users. _(Available on the Runway Pro plan and above.)_ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/562880/7f6156eb-df96-4332-b4d7-c432c4aac58f) ### 💨 Automatically accelerate healthy rollouts If all of your metrics are looking good and your rollout has reached a minimum number of users you define, Runway can accelerate things and release to all users immediately. Getting a good release out to all users more quickly can be just as impactful as halting a bad release! _(Available on the Runway Pro plan and above.)_ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/562880/9088b19a-3ce0-467f-a390-2368f4c92464) # Who is _Rollouts_ for? _Rollouts_ is for mobile teams of all sizes who care about the quality and health of the apps they ship. If you want to ensure you’re not shipping bad product and your users are having the best possible experience, without painstaking babysitting, _Rollouts_ is for you. There are a few folks _Rollouts_ might resonate with especially: * Release captains/drivers/pilots who want to de-stress and de-risk the experience of being in the driving seat during a rollout * Mobile engineers who are tired of poking PMs to check on key events in some analytics dashboard they don’t have access to or don’t understand * PMs who are tired of said mobile engineers poking them all the time * Mobile leads or EMs who want to be sure their entire team has the full picture of release health, to foster a healthy sense of ownership and accountability * Engineering leadership who care about keeping tabs on their mobile org, easily and noise-free * Anyone and everyone who cares about app health and preventing bad releases from making it out to even more users   # How to give _Rollouts_ a try You can sign up for a free trial via the [Runway site](https://www.runway.team), no credit card required, and we’re available to give folks a guided walkthrough as well – just get in touch!

Web3 teams have a significant part of their assets in tokens sitting in treasury, but still have business expenses such as travel bills or web hosting that require USD. 2.

At the same time, we saw an overwhelming demand from customers across the country. ### ### **What We’re Launching:** Locale lets you order food from the most popular eateries across America for only $5 overnight shipping regardless where you live.

The minimum order is just $60. There’s so much good food on Locale that we’re confident you’ll have no problem hitting it. Would love for you to try us out and let me know your thoughts!

The problem is that most standups aren’t that great. People aren’t always prepared so they think out loud. It’s not engaging so people tune out. It’s easy to lose focus and stray off topic. If any of this sounds familiar - please give [Spinach.io](http://Spinach.io) a try and tell us what you think! **How it works** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=66829&key=user_uploads/839578/baa2ba9d-7d8b-4fe1-bb2b-eba6041ab9de) 🥬 **Before standup** - each team member prepares their check-in. You can choose from default Yesterday, Today, Blockers categories or create your own. Organizing your thoughts and planning your day helps you share meaningful context instead of trying to recall what you did yesterday. 🥬 **During standup** - running a great standup takes work, and we do it for you. Spinach rotates through each persons’ check-in so there’s no deciding “who goes next”. If you have additional topics to discuss with the team add them to Team Topics and they’ll get added to the agenda. 🥬 **After standup** - instant notes automatically posted to Slack and saved in app for future reference. Easily share status with stakeholders or catch up if you missed standup. 🥬 **Async friendly** - we support async standups for days where you just want to share status updates but don’t have any blockers or other important topics to discuss. **How to try it** 1\\.

Artemis: Data Science Project Management,"**tl;dr** Artemis is the best platform to document, track, and visualize complex data science projects. We help teams log when and how they use resources (scripts, models, databases, etc.) to create the through yet compensable documentation for their projects. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1018852/4e301d6d-975c-4497-8692-91a0834cdaba) **❌ The Problem:** Data science teams employ a variety of resources often spread across platforms. The way these resources interact in a project is often poorly documented. Documentation systems that do exist rely on direct peer-to-peer collaboration and produce results that are difficult to understand. **✅ The Solution:** Artemis is a platform for organizations to document and map every time a resource is used and how it works so projects can be understood at a glance. 🏆 **Two Steps To Success:** **First,** Artemis teams create archives to document every time they use a resource. The Archive helps users document their resource’s location(s), relationships to other resources, and functions in addition to recording how they’re employed in a specific project. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=66800&key=user_uploads/1018852/718ed567-d130-450d-a425-e25dfdf7c8ee) **Second**, resource deployments archived with Artemis are automagically mapped out to create interactive visual networks. These networks offer a comprehensive, one of a kind perspective that informs leadership decisions and helps individuals understand their work and their peers’ work in context. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=66800&key=user_uploads/1018852/188a66ae-e107-4524-b084-54d62a18eec3) **▶️  Price and Contact** Artemis free to try for 30 days and free to academic institutions forever.

✨ Shimmer: 1:1 ADHD Coaching | 5-10X more affordable than alternatives,"**tl;dr:** We match individuals with **expert ADHD coaches for 1:1 coaching** at a price never offered before. Hi YC family! 👋 We’re Chris & Vikram, and we’re building [Shimmer](http://www.shimmer.care). Our mission is for every individual with ADHD to reach their full potential, _their way_. **❌ The Problem** ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects 5% of adults (13M in US), but most are still struggling to get their symptoms in check. * **It’s not a lack of knowledge, it’s action**: People with ADHD know to make a list, they just don’t do it. We need practice, experimentation, and accountability. * **Good behavioral interventions price most people out:** Quality ADHD coaching costs $300-600+/mo. This prices out, well, the people who need it most. * **The process is cumbersome & not fit for ADHD**: I’ve been there (Chris): dozens of consultation calls, not knowing what to ask, dated technology, confusing e-mail chains, scared to pull the trigger, the list goes on. **✨ Our Solution** Shimmer is a platform that connects expert ADHD coaches with members, facilitates weekly calls, and offers accountability and support via our iOS & Android apps. By truncating or “chunking” the sessions, offering asynchronous tools & resources, and streamlining coaches’ back-end tasks, we offer coaching at 5-10X more affordable than alternatives. **⚙️ How it works** 1. **Join Shimmer**—Members start with an intake form that helps kick off their personalized journey. This helps the coach choose 1 of our 3 science-backed tracks to go down. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/608519/e7fbca25-1704-4a84-82b0-76385ed12955) 2. **Meet your coach**—Members meet weekly (for 15- or 45-min meetings) over video or audio to review progress, unpack topics, and set goals for the upcoming week. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/608519/4f638136-5381-46f7-8b50-3df1e27fdbb3) 3. **Weekly actionable plans**—The real work happens between sessions.

YC Deals - Access to software deals for employees at YC companies,"Hello, [Oliver](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverortlieb/) and [Zach](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-kamran/) here, software engineers at Y Combinator. We are thrilled to announce YC Deals.  Employees at YC companies can now leverage one of the major benefits previously only available to YC founders – [YC Deals](https://deals.ycombinator.com/). Through YC Deals, employees have access to more than 100 discounts and exclusive offers on industry leading tools. There are already $500,000 worth of free credits and discounts available, and new deals are constantly being added. **❌ The Problem** We built YC Deals for our companies with a growing team. The founders still want to take advantage of the wide variety of discounts and free credits that YC companies receive, but their employees don’t have access to Bookface (our internal platform for YC founders), where these exclusive deals are listed.  **✨ Our Solution** Now any employee of a YC company can redeem these deals and help their company save money. Building something new? There are dozens of dev tools like PostHog, Fivetran, and OneSignal.  First HR or ops hire? Get Deel and Stable up and running at a discount. In charge of security? Check out Vanta.  Also find deals on startup staples, like Gusto, GitHub, Algolia, and Amplitude. Help build and grow your company using world-class tools on a startup budget.  ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OVsQc12ujUnJFjcR_OxLDPXrIqj4mEsltXolYe2QhAQEnu2RuZ3Fxv57z2kkc_q2P9rfXhkFKPmJzqM2pJ-th57ArroztYuQQ43o04-PI_6lwk6qWZxnAWciWP6K7x5i8ZTQiBabH2s5ax5vH2n5nh7UUjf1Y4_F3-hK7cxIzjMPxTTyqYIzK0pp) **👉 Next steps** Employees at YC companies can access YC Deals by completing a simple email verification flow using their company email address [here](https://deals.ycombinator.com/).

"Novel, Your International Business Bank Account ​​🌍 🌎","Hey everyone! We’re Aldrin and Paul, from [Novel](https://www.trynovel.com/)! Novel is an international business bank account for global businesses. We provide international founders with a U.S. business bank account, 30+ multi-currency accounts, global payouts in 140+ currencies, and smart debit cards. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ykzg-cdBJIwZ9TXgYARSV16B7poMw7Yd6L4qpQ9luVq1sO8CDaOqUiiT1vTaVq4iscwmdpp5YzGYso1zgE0uuB20sWWSRVAZ6xnoKVVLD5ZGnP0YxxgmkVIYcT7F05CFzz0-Ry1cejUevLIGzWvXvqhL-RCpkS7ChI6KM_mOdED30p4RBCneKDLu5A) **The Problem ‼️** **International businesses can’t access the U.S. financial services they need to grow.** There has been an explosion of global founders choosing to form U.S. entities to make it easier to raise venture funding, use Stripe & PayPal, and sell to U.S. customers.  Unfortunately, since non-U.S. residents don’t have an SSN, traditional financial institutions make it challenging for most global founders to open a real, high quality, FDIC-insured bank account.  Even when it comes to emerging fintechs, international founders in particular have their own unique pain points: funding their business account from a local currency and bank, processing payouts in other currencies, and conducting business without getting their accounts frozen (many international founders using money transfer tools instead of bank accounts have had their accounts or funds frozen for months. Banks often do this as well).  We had one early customer from Argentina come to us after their Wells Fargo account (with over $1M USD deposited) was shut down overnight with no notice! **The Solution 👊🏿** A bank tailored to international founders. In as little as _30 minutes_ after filling out our 10 minute application online, we can open an account for a founder without an SSN.  While many other banks are willing to look at applications from international founders, they still reject upwards of 30%+ of applicants 😥. Novel’s greater understanding of these customers allows us to better accommodate these founders. Our custom KYC process allows us to quickly identify the customer and their risk profile, and issue them an account.  With Novel, founders all over the world can: 1. Quickly open a business checking account and fund via 30+ currencies 2. Receive physical and virtual debit cards 3. Conduct payouts in 140+ currencies (more than any existing bank) 4. Easily do domestic and global transfers at the lowest rates (0.35% above interbank - 2x cheaper than TransferWise) 5. Use their account to access services like Paypal, Stripe, and invoicing   **Think Novel could be a good fit for you or a friend? 💙** We would love for you to try us out. Email us at [sales@trynovel.com](mailto:sales@trynovel.com) and we will provide you a free year of our Plus plan! If you need to move money globally to run your business, we’re here to help. ",Aldrin Clement,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/d82dd8b3915b76180e5e87a9fa4cccd298a88bf1.jpg,,21829

Parsagon: Real-time price indexes,"**tl;dr: Parsagon now offers real-time price indexes by scraping daily prices of retailers.** Parsagon is an AI that can auto-generate web scrapers and data pipelines. With inflation affecting so many consumers and businesses, we had our AI generate dozens of scrapers to collect prices and track inflation for over 50,000 food products across 38 cities in North America. You can access daily inflation estimates per food category (e.g., bread, seafood) and per region (e.g., Northeast U.S., Western U.S.) via our API. For example, here’s the change in price for various foods in the U.S. over the past week: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/145104/6b268c1b-9eb6-4ca6-acd0-d7d19f356145) And earlier this month, when a jump in food inflation sent markets tumbling, our index reported that jump in inflation two weeks before the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the inflation numbers. **Our ask:** If you want access to the API, please contact us at [founders@parsagon.io](mailto:founders@parsagon.io) for a free trial!

Friends who, simply because of where they were born, see their financial freedom limited: hyperinflation, bans on saving in USD, nightmares trying to move money in/out of their country and crazy fees when paying with a card when traveling. After spending a couple of years at Revolut, we learned that Fintech as we know it today is constrained by traditional financial systems, partners, and regulatory frameworks.

🧑‍🚀 Massdriver - Production-ready cloud infrastructure in minutes,"**tl;dr Engineers spend 20-30% of their time reading cloud documentation and fidgeting with tools like Terraform or doing 'ClickOps.' With Massdriver, engineers can provision secure, production-ready cloud infrastructure in minutes without cloud expertise using a simple diagramming interface.** Hey all, we’re Cory, Chris, and David, the team behind [Massdriver.](https://massdriver.cloud) We’re on a mission to radically simplify cloud infrastructure management and ‘DevOps.’ ## 😢 The Problem For many organizations, DevOps is no longer a set of practices and culture. It’s a separate team with its own backlog slowing down your product development. Software today isn’t simply code on a computer. It’s a series of ~~tubes~~ APIs and services stitched together with YAML, tools like Terraform, and complex IAM rules. A bunch of boring plumbing that is slowing down your feature velocity. ## 🪄 Our Solution Massdriver is a visual development platform that lets engineers focus on what services they need from the cloud and easily connect them without worrying about implementation details. Massdriver takes care of secret management, provisioning, parity, best practices, and IAM so your team can focus on your product. Our infrastructure and application bundles are open source, so you can modify them as your organization evolves or create your own and extend the platform. ## ⚙ How It Works Developers can quickly connect dozens of pre-built infrastructure and application bundles designed by industry experts to provision secure production-ready infrastructure in minutes. Massdriver focuses on developer needs, not the implementation details of infrastructure, making it easy for developers of any caliber to get great infrastructure instantly. Our pre-built infrastructure bundles can be forked and modified, and the community can also design their own bundles using Terraform and Helm to extend the platform. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=66021&key=user_uploads/920899/fea74a72-ac18-49a6-bdc5-f8e8af425525) ## 🚀 Out of This World Features * Parity management with replication support for infrastructure and applications between regions, environments, and cloud accounts * Integrated secret management that injects credentials directly into your applications environment variables * Automated principle of least privilege for IAM * Dozens of best-practice reference architecture infrastructure bundles to get started, each open-sourced and designed by industry experts * Compliance and security scanning for official infrastructure bundles * Activity and audit logs of every change to ease your path to compliance * Visually compare differences between environments like staging and production or between deployments * Integrated alerting and monitoring * Application support for containerized and serverless workloads * Enterprise-ready deployments for SaaS products - your product in your customer's cloud account today. ## 🙏 Asks Try it out!

📞 Sameday: Always be available.,"Super thrilled to share Sameday with all of you! Our customers say they’ve never heard anything like it, and that’s the point. People love talking to Sameday’s virtual sales agents. Not only does Sameday sound ultra-human, but it acknowledges a customer’s pain, overcomes objections, and follows up until the sale is made. With a close rate of 80%. Yes, you read that right. **Sameday’s virtual sales agent closes 80% of all sales calls it receives.** ### **❌ The Problem** Home service businesses fail to answer 62% of phone calls. Paying 4X more per lead than any other industry, missing just one sales call costs $80 on average. **Third-party call centers are expensive.** Averaging several dollars per minute, they also fail schedule services effectively; resulting in low sold to service rates and an even higher cost per acquisition. (Most of Sameday’s customers switched from a third-party call center) **Staffing is difficult.** Most hire family and friends to answer the phone, while others attempt to answer it themselves…while on the job…covered in who knows what. Some have large call centers, struggling to balance an acceptable ROI and the turnover that comes with a call center. (Many Sameday customers have call centers with 50+ employees) ### **✅ The Solution** A virtual sales agent that answers any phone calls your team would otherwise miss. But it doesn’t stop there… **Sameday follows up, initiating outbound calls on its own to ensure every lead gets on the schedule.** Combine that with Sameday’s ability to onboard new customers in seconds, ultra-human voice, which we call, “Pro Voice”, and the ability to overcome objections, Sameday eliminates all the common pitfalls of other AI solutions, resulting in our customers saying, “Wow”. **You can learn more at** [**gosameday.com**](https://www.gosameday.com/) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/902840/c08a1316-dc73-4e4e-9ceb-8e27c9800f3d)",Aaron Cooper,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/071775aa0a120ee489fb02fd75a6fd36aebc357d.jpg,Otherimage_27491_1.jpg;,27491
Stellar - Don’t let your team’s OKRs slip in 2023! 📈🌟,"👋 We’re [Angela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angeladao/), [Elise](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisetnguyen/) and [Quan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/quanzhou1/), the co-founders of [Stellar](https://www.stellarapp.io/)! We were early hires at multiple unicorns and saw OKRs both fail and succeed. The orgs that get it right are those that act quickly and adapt to new information consistently over time. Stellar is a goal tracking platform focused on agile communication so your team has a fighting chance of hitting their OKRs. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65966&key=user_uploads/997645/a7331fc6-b81e-4306-90a5-15f1ff0d625f) ### **The problem with OKRs** Setting business goals is easy, but iterative execution is hard. Too many companies set OKRs, forget them in an isolated document and then realize they haven’t made sufficient progress. When OKRs aren’t reassessed openly on a recurring basis, you miss the opportunity to motivate your team, collaborate and unblock progress together. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65966&key=user_uploads/997645/ed098364-c2e7-449f-9436-f637d0041fc2) The designated responsible person (usually a founder or Chief of Staff) spends hours a week running this process, when they could be working on strategic work. ### **Achieve your goals with confidence** If you’re ready to embed OKRs and agile collaboration in your organization, Stellar will help you: 1. Stay focused and organized by linking your goals in an OKR tree 2. Raise and remove blockers quickly through effective, asynchronous check-ins 3.

"Seaflight ✈️ The most efficient, electric air cargo - using wingships","Hi everyone, Graham and Will here, founders at Seaflight Technologies. Rather than waiting for batteries to double in energy density so that electric aviation can start to become A Thing, we started building a more efficient way to fly heavy stuff over longer distances. Using technology that makes economic sense _today_. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/881099/bca0d5f7-b4d4-4a44-b0ae-be1a9d4b4ad3) ### **Coastal and inter-island freight is either very slow or wildly expensive.** Amazon Prime doesn’t mean the same thing once you have to get stuff over water! Whether you’re in Antigua or Australia, Saipan or Sumatra, goods can take days or weeks to come by boat the cheap way. If you need pharmaceuticals, fresh produce, or electronics quickly, expect to pay 10x or 20x in shipping costs to have it flown and it can _still_ take days door to door. Electric aircraft could make this all cheaper and cleaner and faster and… ah. Right. Low range, low payload, high upfront costs. Forgot about that. So for hundreds of millions of people around the world in coastal or island communities that would benefit the most from much cheaper service, the electric aviation revolution just isn’t coming. Unless… ### **Have it wingshipped! Wait… what is a wingship??** Seaflight’s wingships are like aircraft that fly at ultra-low altitude, just a few meters above the water in “ground effect” – like a pelican skimming over the waves. We get way more lift, and a bit less drag, and we don’t waste energy climbing up to altitude. This aerodynamic efficiency gain is super important; it’s as if we waved a magic wand and nearly doubled the energy in a battery pack for free. Wingships are classified as maritime vessels rather than actual aircraft, so we can operate with no FAA certification or integration into airspace needed, which dramatically reduces development costs. Starting with remote piloting, all of this combined can dramatically increase the profit on flown cargo delivery – a sea change (erm…) in an industry where 5% margins are normal. This gives us a SpaceX style advantage - they didn’t develop cheap re-usable rockets just to sell them and let others capture the value. So we’re here to create our own network - basically a new version of FedEx, or a mini-Maersk! ### ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/881099/7e3b036a-4541-41b5-9505-c4d39a79c75d) \\ **“Please. No more hyperloops. How does this become real?”** With you on that. We’re builders. We already have flying scale hardware that we built during the batch, flying with some simple sensor fusion to maintain low altitude over the water. We rapidly iterate hardware at the small scale, and will be able to generate revenue with our next, larger prototypes - this isn’t a 10 year, billion dollar vaporware effort, this is happening now with multiple partners in our first markets. Oh, and we have funding from the National Science Foundation backing our key aerodynamic tech - that’s hardcore, peer-reviewed, revolutionary IP. ### **About the founders :** Graham has a PhD in the aerodynamics of ultra-low altitude flight, which is handy! Graham and Will met at California Polytechnic State University, where Graham was a Lockheed Martin Professor of Aerospace Engineering and Will was leading a land speed record solar car project that Graham had initiated after gaining two successful world speed records himself. A few years later, after Graham had led the aerodynamics and range team for commercial/delivery vehicles at EV startup Canoo, and Will had worked technical program management on production of remote-piloted aircraft at General Atomics, the two reconvened. Decarbonization of aviation is one of the biggest craziest hardest challenges of any industry, so we started hacking away in the garage… ### **Lastly, Asks 🙏** Could you connect us to **anyone in a branch of the military** who’s actively involved in logistics? Do you have any **friends or colleagues that are involved in ocean research** that could hop on a call with us? Do you know **any wizards in machine vision / autonomous mobility** who are looking for a bonkers new professional challenge?",Graham Doig,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/a31c91732204ac6b1751cdf7365ad61022f47494.jpg,Otherimage_26784_1.jpg;Otherimage_26784_2.jpg;,26784
Pasito - Saving companies and employees money on healthcare and payroll,"**_Tl;dr:_** _Pasito uses personal health, payroll, and financial data to guide employees to elect and use their health and voluntary benefits. For companies, we drastically cut avoidable healthcare and payroll spending. For employees, we provide personalized guidance on their healthcare and benefits and save them time and money._ [_Connect with Pasito today._](https://joinpasito.com/) \\ Hi everyone, we are Pauline, Ignacio, and Julie and we're on a mission to improve financial and health outcomes for individuals and their families through smarter employee benefits elections and engagement. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7giIUNKO13jrLMyDx0uPrK4RUw-1oydIUD2hU9OKBjnmzA3uzPgvNQwBbwHEcanedgG8yBM3p_dO6c9USZ6rEfo6IipFoTHz0c1dL1hSu2tKXyxXL38uLZlB_q8q8aa_1rGz8Ks5say1sNxvJGsJOfkoyePM4h7xfJXO9bY6ZxoisJ7o065yFKY6ng) ### **🧨 The Problem: Health and wealth benefits are a maze** Employees blindly select their health and wealth benefits which means employees are often over-insured while under-saving for retirement.  Take our client Sarah as an example. Sarah elects her company’s PPO health plan because she isn’t sure which option to choose. Based on her family’s income and health data, Sarah could have saved over $2,000 by electing and using an HSA-eligible health plan. These savings could have gone to paying for medical expenses, paying down debt, or saving for retirement. Since Sarah’s company pays 80% of health insurance premiums, they have also overspent $3,000+.  ### 🎉 **The Solution: Personalized benefits selection and engagement at scale** Pasito saves companies money on healthcare and payroll by guiding their employees to make better and more efficient health and retirement benefits decisions. Our webapp uses company and personal data to optimize benefits coverage and help employees use their benefits year-round including:  💼 Payroll data  ❤️ Health data  🪙 Financial data  👱🏽 Family data  🏢 Benefits data  ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/030tk1g9d968V-120hXBe5m-jxZMg2LhKWbhIU7CpTjlr_liNMDTlpgYYk0ehI7u2RSS2Wb8vpT_LAetNf1xRUMT5W9RQ1FIH69eTw21Uf87dEBGqVsG3veqIy7X6E7emdnCUaO71M2Wh41Dvc05bkU) Using Pasito, **employees**:  ✔️ Save $2,000+ on average  ✔️ Finallyyyy understand how to use their benefits  And **companies**:  ✔️ Save thousands (if not millions) of dollars on premiums, healthcare expenses, and payroll taxes  ✔️ Show the value of their full benefits package to employees and candidates ✔️ Reduce the personal questions received from employees  ### ### 💲**Opportunity: The thrilling scope and impact of our market** There are 300 Sarahs in every company of 1,000 employees. That’s almost $1m in wasted health and benefits spend for Sarah’s company.  Across the US there are 48 million Sarahs and a mind-shattering $200+ billion is wasted each year from poor health insurance and benefits elections. This capital could instead be invested to deliver better financial and health outcomes, and to reduce the $190+ billion in US medical debt.    ### **👋** **Ask: How you can help** * Connect us to CFOs and HR leaders in your network.

Knowtex: Creating Visit Notes from Doctor-Patient Conversations,"👋 We’re [Jocelyn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jocelynkang/) and [Caroline](https://www.linkedin.com/in/czhang21/), the co-founders of [Knowtex](https://www.knowtex.ai/)! **tldr;** Knowtex automatically creates visit notes with billing codes from doctor-patient conversations. We built our ML solution in under two months and are working with healthcare organizations to save doctors time and prevent revenue leakage from improper documentation and coding. Our ask is for help connecting with private clinics (with 8+ doctors) in any specialty, digital healthcare companies with providers, and PE firms with medical roll-ups. ### **The Problem:** Doctors are spending more time on taking notes than seeing patients, and aren’t taught how to code their notes optimally for proper reimbursement. This leads to physician burnout and revenue leakage for healthcare organizations (up to $125 billion a year in the US). ### **Our Solution:** Knowtex creates visit notes with the proper codes for reimbursement automatically from doctor-patient conversation. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65893&key=user_uploads/556751/cbde38bb-69a5-49a9-b723-fc0b8bf65864) (The automatically generated note output from a conversation Caroline had in real-time with a cardiologist!) **Wait, doctors code?** We’re not talking about software coding, but medical coding, which means assigning the right diagnostic (ICD-10) and procedural codes (CPT) to a note to allow a claim to be created and submitted to insurers for appropriate payment. Correct coding is also critical for demographic assessments and studies of disease prevalence, treatment outcomes and accountability-based reimbursement systems. With Knowtex, we can cut the time doctors currently spend on admin work in half, and allow them to focus on what they love: patient care. ### **Our Team** We met day one of Stanford freshmen year. Caroline received her master's degree in Computer Science concentrating in AI and an undergraduate degree in Economics (in just 4 years!). Jocelyn received an interdisciplinary degree in CS specializing in Linguistics and has worked at startups in a variety of positions including leading AI/ML teams. After graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic, we wanted to apply our technical skills to build solutions for our healthcare system. We heard about the problem of physician burnout from medical documentation, and **became medical scribes ourselves to experience it firsthand. We’re the only medical scribes in the world with AI/ML backgrounds,** making us uniquely positioned to build this solution for doctors. ### **Our Ask** We’re looking to partner with * private clinics that have 8+ doctors in any specialty * digital health companies that offer healthcare provider services (ex. hybrid and virtual care, telemedicine platforms) * private equity companies with medical roll-ups Here’s a quick blurb you can send them about us: _Knowtex reduces physician documentation burden and increases coding efficiency and accuracy by automatically creating visit notes with billing codes from doctor-patient conversations. Our software captures natural conversation, identifies relevant medical information, and generates a pre-filled, structured note with ICD-10 and CPT codes for physician sign-off._ _Founders Caroline and Jocelyn are Stanford CS grads who specialized in AI and previously worked as medical scribes. We're looking to speak to healthcare organizations to understand more about their doctors’ documentation workflows and coding requirements, and explore partnership opportunities with our product. You can reach us at_ [_founders@knowtex.ai_](mailto:founders@knowtex.ai)_._ Thank you! \\- Jocelyn and Caroline ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65893&key=user_uploads/556751/d7306386-438d-4c47-ba29-4b230bbc3c29)",Jocelyn Kang,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/a02f8d0613fb26a711269f429a755a08d7024edb.jpg,Otherimage_27185_1.jpg;Otherimage_27185_2.jpg;,27185

🎥 the402: Monetize superfans through livestreams and NFTs,"Hey everyone! We’re Ravi & Narahari from the402 **the402 helps creators monetize their superfans through livestreams and NFTs** For example, an artist can perform new songs on a private livestream and superfans attend by buying an NFT Since launching a little over a month ago, each artist on our platform is **averaging around $700 / livestream**  ``` One creator made ~$1.3k from one livestream ``` * On Twitch he streams 16 times a month to make \\~$250 ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65840&key=user_uploads/492765/0e898bb6-cbf6-4f24-a826-e14dd0516fab) **Problem:** _My co-founder Narahari is a top 3% Twitch streamer. He grew frustrated that he had fans who wanted to pay more but didn’t have an easy way to do so_ * Current platforms are great for creators to get mass distribution, but they hardly make money off their content alone * There are superfans/patrons that have an extremely high willingness to pay, but don’t have a great mechanism to do so (even on Patreon, only 2% of the users make more than minimum wage) **How it works:** 1. Create an NFT access pass for a livestream and/or use existing NFTs to gate your livestream 2. The NFT issued is liquid with dynamic pricing using our protocol, which allows there to be a market created around the stream 3. Fans can purchase an NFT either with crypto or credit card 4. Once the livestream starts, those who hold the NFT have access to the livestream & can interact with the creator / each other ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65840&key=user_uploads/492765/c7d32b98-4120-45c9-9762-26604e517c10) \\ You can also stream for free and monetize through NFT sales, auctions, or emotes during the livestream  **Abstracting away crypto:** * Even though we’re using NFTs to serve as the access pass, we abstract this away with optional credit card payments  * The end consumer just needs to know that they’re buying a digital ticket that gives them access to a livestream **So why NFTs/crypto? What’s the crypto use case here:** * NFTs allow for a global market to be spun up around a creator/event easily  * Decentralized access control - NFTs can be used for multiple use cases independent of the platform they were bought on (i.e. you can gain access to another livestream, redeem for an IRL concert, access to private discord, special merch etc.) * The relationship between fan & creator becomes P2P + tied to your digital identity   * Proof of fandom / patronage can be flexed * Existing tokens can be used permissionlessly to gate content **Asks:** We are actively onboarding creators onto our platform and would love any introductions!

Traditionally, shippers and brokers have located the 3.5 million OTR trucks in the US mainly through “check calls” (manually calling a truck driver every 2 hours to ask for current location and ETA) One of our users doing check calls and recording locations manually pre-LiveTrucks: ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/5lWwZ6ZMsfvkodS8c981Zbn-S2aA9SM319ewCWoqiUjiqc-GQag30mxOOwl7wdxpEaHIeBIAxJjUfweRAMLUHHODd7xcPhLz_E5iGyeaqUsLNK-CTXhjytNs__MtknFqXAZaPb_pmLre1ZBo0nAoY5TxEZXYnrAodv9UL81cQKxjNiaBywGEuSXjaQ) \\ My cofounder Tanuj first saw this problem internally at UberFreight (Uber’s freight brokerage) where hours were wasted per load in simply locating the truck.

Convoy: Open Source Webhooks Proxy,"**TL;DR: Convoy provides a reliable webhooks proxy that can ingest webhooks from all your providers and replay them to your backend as well as publish webhook events from your systems to your customers.** Hey YC 👋🏾 I am Subomi, and I am building [Convoy](https://getconvoy.io) alongside Emmanuel. **The Problem**\\ Today, webhooks power critical business workflows that, if broken, will have a direct impact on customers’ experience. Usually, developers spend time building reliable webhook ingestion services and reliable webhook dispatching services for API providers. This time is wasted effort that can be spent building necessary infrastructure instead of building your product. Secondly, the tooling becomes fragmented for dispatching and receiving webhook events. We are working on Convoy to solve precisely this using a consistent toolchain to receive, publish and debug webhook events. **Our Solution**\\ Enter Convoy, a service available as an open-source project and a cloud platform. There are two types of projects in Convoy; an incoming project and an outgoing project. In an incoming project, we provide a unique URL per provider to receive events, and in an outgoing project, we provide a REST API to receive events from your services and publish them to the outside world. **How it works?** You can see a demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSIet81oBsg). **Asks** 1. If you’re building an API that sends out webhooks and/or a service that relies on webhooks from third-party providers, you can get started for free by either [self-hosting](https://getconvoy.io/docs/deploy/overview) or using our [cloud platform](https://dashboard.getconvoy.io/signup). 2.

But, because spatial data is heterogenous, creating the ETL scripts, cloud infrastructure, and analysis pipelines to use it takes months—something we saw ourselves. We spent a year trying to analyze real estate with AI, and the first three months were dedicated to building these data pipelines. We realized every company that wants to use spatial databases suffers from the same problems. **🔧 Solution** We handle the pipeline and the database for you. Behind the scenes we do all the leg work to work with spatial data so you can focus on building your product. For example, we automatically [convert addresses in CSVs into a PostGIS table via geocoding](https://buntinglabs.com/flows/import-csv-geocode-into-postgis). Here’s how managing spatial data on bunting would look like for you: 1. Upload any data file, and we’ll automatically recognize how it relates to the Earth. We currently support [KML](https://buntinglabs.com/flows/import-csv-geocode-into-postgis), [CSV](https://buntinglabs.com/flows/import-csv-geocode-into-postgis), [GeoJSON](https://buntinglabs.com/flows/importing-geojson-files-into-postgis), [GeoPackage](https://buntinglabs.com/flows/upload-geopackage-contents-to-postgis), and [Excel](https://buntinglabs.com/flows/load-excel-file-into-postgis). 2. We’ll save it to a managed PostGIS instance (on Amazon RDS) and give you SELECT permissions to your tables. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65769&key=user_uploads/786838/6daa1005-b597-472c-90ad-b16067886c47) Coming soon: low-code spatial analysis tool and purpose-built spatial data labeling. Everything you need to build an app with spatial data. **👉 Ask** Do you work with spatial data and are willing to share your experiences? Shoot us an email at [founders@buntinglabs.com](mailto:founders@buntinglabs.com), we would love to talk. Do you work at a company that is working on implementing or wants to implement any spatial features? Email us at [founders@buntinglabs.com](mailto:founders@buntinglabs.com), we would love to work with you to do whatever it takes to make your vision a reality! **💻 Open Source** Bunting is built on open source and sponsors development of [mundipy, a Python framework for geospatial data](https://docs.mundi.ai/).",Michael Egan,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/de1f5ca9527b98ffd46f3831e344b731c5337b55.jpg,Otherimage_26712_1.jpg;,26712
Apprecio - Helping the 10M mom & pop shops in Latam accept card payments,"``` print(“hello world!”) ``` **Problem:** Mom & pop shops in Latam (tienditas) represent +60% of total sales for CPG companies like Coca-Cola, and still 9 out of 10 sales are still done in cash and managed with pen and paper. These businesses manage inventory, purchases, sales and credit in a notebook. Existing POS solutions require these businesses to buy a computer or tablet, a barcode scanner, a license and signup with a payment processor/gateway. **Solution** Apprecio is a mobile app that allows businesses to manage sales, purchases, inventory and payments. With our built-in product scanner enabled by the camera we are able to save hours of time for them as it is faster to use than pen and paper! They don’t even have to upload SKU codes manually as we have a +20,000 proprietary product data base with price information attached to their location. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65758&key=user_uploads/435212/dc7772f9-508e-4424-b061-7f7f9756f450) While building this, we realized very quickly that store owners lose 30% of their sales by not accepting card payments. That’s why we decided to build a payments solution for them that just went live with our first beta testers. Right now we are only focused in Mexico, but we are looking to expand to other countries in LATAM. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65758&key=user_uploads/435212/c9057c93-ccbf-406e-8434-fc86d9ff524b) **Ask:** * If you think we can collaborate somehow feel free to reach out! * If you live in Latam and you have a trusted tendero show them Apprecio Wanna talk?

Signadot: Ephemeral Test Environments built for Kubernetes,"### 😎 **TL;DR** We’re building a Kubernetes-based solution that enables environments, called Sandboxes, to test your microservices early in the development lifecycle. Unlike traditional environments, Sandboxes are lightweight and spin up in seconds. This makes it cost-effective to create test environments for every pull request, branch, and commit. ### 🤔 **The problem with traditional environments** Most engineering teams use pre-production environments, called staging environments, to test against real-world conditions. However, testing on staging introduces the following challenges: 1. Staging environments are typically shared among engineering teams and regressions introduced here block other developers. This results in frequent roll backs to unblock others. 2. Since commits from various teams are co-mingled on staging, breakages take a long time to troubleshoot and fix. As the engineering team grows, this problem only gets worse and development slows down. ### **😅 Enter Signadot** With Signadot, DevOps teams can set up lightweight environments, called Sandboxes, that can be used to test each pull request/commit. Teams run a suite of integration and end-to-end tests for each PR without impacting others. This helps find issues early that would otherwise be found in staging (or worse … in production!). Our CLI/YAML integrates with CI pipelines to automate the testing of Pull Requests. As shown in the image below, Sandboxes encapsulate “services-under-test” connected to other dependencies running in Kubernetes. Sandboxes are lightweight to spin up and cost-efficient at scale. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65752&key=user_uploads/47401/edb398f0-819b-43f3-9152-9ba015164069) ### **🤓 How this helps your team:** * Minimize rollbacks on staging and production * Increase the frequency of production deployments * Save on infrastructure costs using lightweight Sandboxes ### **🤩 Try us out!** 1.

InVision: AI Diagnosis of Heart Disease,"Hello! We’re Bryan and David, the founders of [InVision](http://invisionmedtech.com/). At InVision, we develop AI tools to quickly and accurately diagnose heart disease.  ### **Challenges in Diagnosing Heart Disease** 32 million heart ultrasounds are performed in the United States each year to diagnose heart disease. Acquiring and interpreting ultrasounds is time-consuming, requiring over an hour of physician and technician time for each exam. Additionally, there exists considerable human-to-human variability when interpreting the ultrasounds, resulting in misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of heart disease.  ### **Our Solution** At InVision, we use AI to help streamline the interpretation of ultrasounds and identify undiagnosed diseases. Our models have been tightly integrated into the clinical workflow to allow easy usage by clinicians. We’re leading the first and only blinded randomized trial of AI technology in cardiology, and we will be presenting as a [headliner clinical trial](https://twitter.com/David_Ouyang/status/1562834463343935491) at the largest cardiology conference ([European Society of Cardiology](https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-&-Events/ESC-Congress)) meeting tomorrow! ### **About us** David majored in Statistics at Rice University, did his MD at UCSF, and did residency and fellowship training in cardiology at Stanford University. David then worked as an attending cardiologist at Cedars Sinai Medical Center, a leading heart health system which will be the first site of deployment of our technology. Bryan majored in CS at Caltech and did his CS PhD at Stanford. Together, we've worked together on this project for the last 4 years, first as a research project and now as clinical deployment of a viable product. ### **Where We Are** Our work has previously been peer-reviewed and published in several top medical venues, including Nature (2020), Nature Medicine (2021), Lancet Digital Health (2021), JAMA Cardiology (2022). Results from our blinded and randomized clinical trial on evaluating cardiac function have also been recently presented as a Late Breaking Clinical Trial at the European Society of Cardiology. We are currently working on securing FDA clearance for our heart failure model and starting up clinical trials for our model screening for cardiac amyloidosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and aortic stenosis. ### **How You Can Help** If you or anyone you know would be interested in helping out, we’d be grateful for introductions to: * Companies who have previously gone through the FDA regulatory process * Investors interested in medical technology * Hospitals and medical device manufacturers that may be interested in our product We can be reached at [founders@invisionmedtech.com](mailto:founders@invisionmedtech.com).

Guardian Bio - Control Immunity with Dendritic Cells,"# tl;dr Your immune system keeps you healthy. If it loses control, diseases like cancer, chronic infections, and autoimmunity can develop. We created a platform that enables us to produce a master regulator of the immune system (the dendritic cell) from patient stem cells. We program these cells so that they can make corrections to dysfunctional immune systems and bring disease back under control. We’re starting with cancer. # Team Prior to starting Guardian Bio, Ananya… * Was a Blavatnik Fellow at Harvard Business School, a fellowship fostering life science entrepreneurship  * Worked across Operations, Engineering, and Project Management in the manufacturing and development side of the pharma/biotech industry * Received dual Masters in Engineering Sciences and MBA from Havard, where she was a Kaplan Fellow, and graduated with honors from Duke with a degree in Biomedical Engineering Prior to starting Guardian Bio, Ricky… * Was a Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Pennsylvania - tumor microenvironment, tumor immunity, and cell therapy * Co-Founded the Philadelphia chapter of Nucleate, a free and collaborative trainee-led organization that facilitates the formation of pioneering life sciences companies * Earned a PhD in Biomedical Sciences - Immunology at University of Central Florida * Worked as a marine biologist and scientific diver at Florida Atlantic University * And continues to create science communication content for social media platforms, reaching an audience of over a quarter million followers across TikTok and Instagram # The Problem The overall problem is that the immune system unfortunately can’t always maintain control over disease. Cancer specifically actively suppresses the immune system. It has to. If the immune system maintains control, it will kill the cancer and disease will not develop.  One of the immune cell types often suppressed by cancer are dendritic cells, which sit at the helm of the immune system. Dendritic cells (DCs) direct and dictate immune responses. DCs are often deficient or dysfunctional in cancer patients, creating severe limitations in the body’s ability to fight off cancer, even when treatments like chemo and immunotherapy are applied. # The Solution We take stem cells from cancer patients, turn them into dendritic cells, program them against that patient’s tumor, and re-introduce them back into the body. This stimulates a diverse yet targeted and robust immune response against the cancer.  # The Platform Our dendritic cell-based platform can be adapted to a variety of diseases. When we train DCs against different targets, our therapy can reignite immune responses against chronic infectious diseases or suppress immune cells triggering autoimmunity. Our dendritic cell-based therapy is synergistic with many other immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors, peptide and mRNA-based cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, etc, potentially extending the reach of these therapies to patients who would not have responded before. ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Fog7y2f3-PsbDww_4qw_LbLzzzM_3yXUEMVPMps50vCfN5dnHauQFTn72dLW2hd1RjKghsjpl8HwpSrJ_zMOe-QneWuKm_BLkumbU-01HqsRlLddaJ8713teujTfrYSRd0y9lsxxqffoBgvUwzGsXg)",Ricky Barrett,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/d88e6393dfe01aade28a018e01a7447dab3b88e4.jpg,,27263

In all of these cases, companies struggle to understand user behaviour and performance, and they risk customer loss if an employee leaves. ### The Devyce Solution⚗️ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/982968/87c27f9a-1901-4c85-9f59-269aa9e01ba8) Devyce customers use a portal to instantly allocate (and deallocate) numbers to employees, auto-attendants and call groups. They see calling stats and have the option to record calls and view a detailed call history. * Our monthly charge of around **$20 per user** is significantly lower than the price of a second handset.🪙 * Users can be given **one or many mobile or landline numbers** instantly, from the UK, several European countries, and the US. 🌍 * Our product is designed for **mobile first**, and our apps get fantastic [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/devyce/id1504660924) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.devyce.client&hl=en&gl=UK) reviews. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ ### Our Magic Beans 🪄 Devyce has a close relationship with a UK mobile network operator. This not only gives us unbeatably low call costs (we’re paid to receive calls), but as we are expanding it lets us overcome regulatory issues in territories outside the UK. Our tech’s second to none. We’re not just building a phone system, we’re redefining what it does. With **automated call summarization, CRM integrations and smart call routing** all in development we’re delighting both our customers _and their customers_. We’re reducing the number of missed calls, which means our customers get more sales opportunities and win twice by switching to us. ### Our Story 📖 ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/982968/dc616887-712d-40c4-b296-cf41f714b9ca) Nick’s background is in investment banking. However, while studying for his qualifications, he dabbled briefly in both real estate and recruitment. This gave him an insight into the pain points faced by both of those phone-intensive businesses, something that stayed with him until the opportunity to fix it arose. Ed graduated from Cambridge with a Computer Science degree in 2004. He worked for some of the most selective London tech companies such as Softwire and G-Research, before moving to Vietnam for a few years and doing some freelance mobile development (as well as dabbling in VoIP). We met through a mutual friend, Leo Bartle, who owns the aforementioned UK mobile network. Leo’s turned that network around from near bankruptcy, and it now supplies numbers to companies such as Salesforce and Google. He runs the mobile network day-to-day, and works closely with us through that as an increasingly active co-founder. # Get Devyce ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/982968/190c4b2c-2163-40ab-b94d-83c149522949) We’ve been selling for a year and a half, so our core telephone offering is reasonably mature and stable.

This is an issue that countless remote learning, productivity, online social, and metaverse platforms face when building their products. ### [💡](https://emojipedia.org/light-bulb/) **Our Solution** Enter Hyperbeam—an API that lets you embed virtual computers anywhere, including web, mobile, VR, and even VSCode. You can then open any third-party website or application, synchronize audio and video flawlessly among multiple participants, and add multi-user control with just a few lines of code. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65609&key=user_uploads/858376/f7507431-2db0-45e9-bcf7-5bbde27ebb1a) ### [⚙️](https://emojipedia.org/gear/) **How it Works** 1. [Sign up](https://hyperbeam.com/?ch=yc&cm=lyc1) on the Hyperbeam Dashboard 2. Generate an API key and integrate the Hyperbeam API 3. Customize the UX to your use case (e.g. control permissions, FPS, permitted websites, WebGL) 4. Launch and track your user engagement! On the backend, we’re spinning up a VM and running a resource-optimized fork of Chromium which we then stream to participants via WebRTC. Since we’re hosting the servers running the applications, multiple users can connect and control the virtual computer seamlessly, and their client just needs to handle a video stream. ### **🙏 Asks** If you or someone you know is building a… * [🎓](https://emojipedia.org/graduation-cap/) Remote learning platform * [🏢](https://emojipedia.org/office-building/) Virtual office * [💻](https://emojipedia.org/laptop/) Remote productivity tool * 👾 Metaverse * [🏟️](https://emojipedia.org/stadium/) Virtual conferencing app * [🥽](https://emojipedia.org/goggles/) VR app …we’d love to talk! **Join us on** [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/D78RsGfQjq)**,** [**book a meeting**](https://meetings.hubspot.com/hyperbeam/founders) **with the founders, or** [**sign up**](https://hyperbeam.com?ch=yc&cm=lyc1) **for a free API key.

"Fondo - 💰 Automatically get cash back from the IRS (average startup gets $21,000)","👋 Hi everyone, David here, former accountant & CEO/Founder of [Fondo](https://tryfondo.com/credits) (W18). Last week, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law -- which includes doubling the **R&D Credit available per startup to up to $500k per year**. This is great news for startups and we’d love to help you get the maximum money back from the IRS. ### 💰 **Automatically get cash back from the IRS (average startup gets $21,000)** Today, we are publicly launching [Fondo Tax Credits](https://tryfondo.com/credits) to help startups get cash back from the IRS. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65591&key=user_uploads/51966/d7c2588f-c394-4e86-8baf-ae15c253c2ae) Thank you to [@Career Karma](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/career-karma), [@Explo,](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/explo) [@PostHog](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/posthog), [@Tydo](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/polyops), & [@Bottomless](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/bottomless) being our first 5 Tax Credit customers. ### **Does my startup qualify?** Most likely, yes! Startups with less than $5M in gross receipts will generally qualify. Because of the broad definition for qualified activities, startups from almost every industry have claimed R&D tax credits. If you have employees or contractors in the United States who spend any time developing new or improved products, processes, software, algorithms, formulas, or inventions, then you likely qualify for the R&D tax credit. [See if your startup qualifies →](https://tryfondo.com/credits-check) ### **How much does my startup qualify for?** The amount of money you can get back is based on your company's R&D expenses (founder/employee/contractor payroll) and can be up to $500k per year. [See how much you can get back with our Tax Credit Calculator →](https://tryfondo.com/credits-check) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65591&key=user_uploads/51966/73b455e4-aa8b-4ad6-8b75-ce55a8873d1f) ### **How do I claim the credit?** Fondo handles all of this for you — the credit is claimed by doing an R&D Credit study, filing additional forms with your corporate tax returns, and updating your payroll system. [Get started here →](https://tryfondo.com/credits) ### **⚠️ Upcoming Deadline** The deadline to claim this credit for 2021 is 10/17/22 (if you filed an extension), otherwise you can claim the credit for 2022. ### 🤝 **DEAL: 25% OFF Tax Credits** _Sign up by 8/25/22 to use this deal._ You only pay Fondo if we can help you get money back. Typically, our fees will not exceed 20% of the amount we can help you get back. This deal will cap the amount you pay Fondo at 15%. [👉 Sign up here →](https://tryfondo.com/credits) ### **What do you get?** The benefits of claiming your tax credits with Fondo is that we can handle everything you need to get it done -- end-to-end. Most of our competitors will only do the R&D study and you still need to find someone else to (1) file your tax returns with the attached R&D credit forms, (2) update your payroll system, and (3) do your bookkeeping. * ✅ Cash back from the IRS (Fondo will complete the R&D Credit Study, prepare Tax Forms, and make required updates to your payroll system) * ☑️ Optional Add-on: [TaxPass](https://tryfondo.com/taxpass) - Delaware + Federal/State Corporate Income Taxes Filed (timely filings that you need to claim the credit) * ☑️ Optional Add-on: [Bookkeeping](https://tryfondo.com/bookkeeping) (get financial statements that you need to file your tax returns) ### **We’d love to support you!** Thank you!

Stream ~ modernizing the workers' comp claim process,"Hey there 👋 We’re [@Eric Yen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeneric/) & [@Eilam Levitov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eilamlevitov/) founders of [Stream](https://www.stream.claims/) (S22). **tl;dr** The two of us are insurance and tech veterans innovating in commercial insurance claims. At Stream we automate the high-touch workflows workers’ comp claims adjusters do on a daily basis. Our platform saves adjuster time spent on repetitive tasks like calling and faxing, allowing the adjuster to focus on the high-value claim activities that improve the injured workers’ claim experience and optimize financial outcomes for insurance companies. **The Problem** 🤕 Workers’ Compensation (WC) insurance is a government-mandated program that provides benefits to workers who get hurt on the job. When a workplace injury occurs, a claim is filed on behalf of the injured worker. This claim pays out for the wages and medical treatment needed to get the employee back to work. Today, claim adjudication is a grossly manual process which involves adjusters spending the majority of their day either on the phone tracking down information or entering unstructured notes into legacy systems. The average adjuster handles 140 cases at any single time and takes 5 business days to respond to inquiries from injured workers. Consequently, the Injured worker is left alone to navigate an unfamiliar and complex claims process. Imagine feeling vulnerable with no clue how your bills will be paid. This pushes injured workers to the brink and inevitably to the front door of their local injury lawyer. In states like CA & FL, over one third of all WC claims are litigated - and the moment an attorney gets involved, that claim balloons 5x in cost. **\\~ Stream** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65582&key=user_uploads/986387/9172c9b2-5a9e-4064-80b6-d180a335c129) The two of us met at Next Insurance, where Eric led WC product and Eilam led Risk Engineering. Eric also previously worked at Liberty Mutual as a WC claims adjuster for 5 years. At Next, we realized nothing has changed since Eric’s days as an adjuster and none of the automation we were building for the underwriting side exists in claims management today. That’s why we left to build Stream. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65582&key=user_uploads/986387/9c055997-8925-4c23-b75b-7117213d6550) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65582&key=user_uploads/986387/b33699f2-0c61-43aa-a3fc-a98ddeca5c3f) Stream saves up to 40% of an adjuster’s time spent on the phone, sending faxes, and manually typing notes into their claim system. Moreover, we also improve the claim experience for the injured worker by providing real-time information such as claim status and financial updates, and help facilitate services such as transportation to doctors offices - all via text. **Our ask** Know anyone working in commercial insurance or with experience in claims processing? We’d love an intro! \\ Feel free to reach out to us - [founders@stream.claims](mailto:founders@stream.claims) \\ Thanks, Eric & Eilam [www.stream.claims](http://www.stream.claims)",Eilam Levitov,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/03f8cd6b78b61ea29f348cf34437350494e0d99c.jpg,Otherimage_26661_1.jpg;Otherimage_26661_2.jpg;Otherimage_26661_3.jpg;,26661

Serinus Biosciences: Killing cancer with its own genetics 💪🏽,"We're **Adam** and **Max**, the founders of **Serinus Biosciences** 💊💻🤓 At Serinus, we develop drugs that are effective against **multiple types of cancer**, and because cancer patients need solutions now, we do it in **months instead of years!** ### **_Cancer: an insidious disease with insidious economics_** 💰💰💰 Currently, **more than 80% of cancer patients** are not eligible for targeted cancer therapies - the most efficient and least toxic cancer treatments. _Why?_ Because the proteins driving cancer in one patient are often different than those driving cancer in another patient. Here's where the economics comes in. The cost of bringing a new cancer drug to market is currently **>$2.5 BILLION**. Developing a drug against a protein that only causes cancer in a small number of patients each year is just not economically viable with traditional drug development. ### **_The Serinus Strategy_** 💡 While building AI tools to understand the causes of cancer during our PhDs at MIT, we had a realization: all the different cancer-causing proteins disrupt the same cellular systems. **We shut down these shared dysfunctional systems.** _How?_ We look for the support proteins that keep the system functioning. Think about a telephone system ☎️ If you want to bring it down, you should find the small number of relay stations that route messages across the network instead of hitting the individual phones. **We find the relay stations of cancer cells and bring them dow**n ☠️☠️☠️ Since cancer systems are widely shared across patients, the relays that support those systems are widely shared across patients. Our current pipeline **could help more than 100K PATIENTS PER-YEAR!** ### **_The knowledge (and stubbornness) to get it done_** 🤓 😎 We met on the very first day of our PhDs at MIT. It was a cancer-fighting match made in heaven. Adam comes from an AI/ML background, Max comes from a biology and statistics background, having given up his place in medical school so he could develop new treatments for patients in need by merging biology, mathematics, and computer science. Oh, and did we mention that Adam is a former Navy SEALs commander and Max spent five years as a paramedic. **_How can you help?_** Our platform is churning out way more ways to kill cancer than we can pursue ourselves. If you or someone you know works at another therapeutics company that might be interested in co-developing a drug with us, give us a shout on [founders@serinus.bio](mailto:founders@serinus.bio)",Adam Yaari,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/be559be7ab070663acd06da510435c67603327ef.jpg,,26734
🛰️ Array Labs - 3D imaging from space,"Hi YC! We’re Andrew and Isaac, the founders of Array Labs. We're designing swarms of tiny satellites which will work together to create the first real-time, high-resolution 3D model of the earth. ### **Our Solution** By using clusters of satellites to image the same place on the earth at the exact same time, we can improve image quality by more than 60x over conventional techniques. ### **The Market** There’s a huge need for accurate 3D data, but it’s always been extremely expensive to collect. Our technology will massively increase the amount of affordable, high-quality 3D data, enabling a host of new applications across an array of industries, including AR/XR/Autonomy, Defense, Climate/ESG, and Insurance Analytics. ### **We need help** We need all the help we can in finding talented engineers.

Roforco — The game studio without hit-risk.,"> **TL;DR:** [Roforco](https://www.roforco.com/) is a Roblox game studio that creates consistent hits by mass producing games - like a game factory! We acquire and complete unfinished projects, then cross promote them within our portfolio.\\ > \\ > Hey ! [👋](https://emojipedia.org/waving-hand/#:\\~:text=A%20hand%20waving%20most%20commonly,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.) [Tom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-middleton-22950a212/) and [Brain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brain-xiang-75b033217/) (aka. the Roblox guys) here to introduce [Roforco](https://www.roforco.com/)! ### 🧨 **The Problem** There’s over 200bn$ in (video) gaming. Individual games can pull in hundreds of millions annually. Investors love this opportunity, but **it’s impossible to predict if a studio’s next title will be popular**, make money back or land well. \\ \\ Games are expensive to make and are inconsistently successful.\\ **This is called hit based risk, or as we dubbed it ‘hit-risk’** ### 🤔 **Why Roblox?** **There will always be at least one popular platform people make games for**. At the moment, it’s Roblox with a 2bn$ market and over 200mm MAU. We’re also deeply familiar with the platform, having **previously built an agency that grossed 500k$ of revenue in 6 mo** and partnered with brands including Unilever. ### 🔎 **The Insight** Indie game developers **have a tendency to never finish projects they start.** After doing the fun parts like the game loop, closing out the game for release is often too difficult, boring and resource intensive. Every game developer (on Roblox) that we know has at least 2 unfinished or abandoned projects.\\ \\ **There are 10 million developers registered on Roblox in comparison to 44k on Steam.** Compared to the years AAA takes to produce one title (or 6-18 months in mobile), **on Roblox the average time to develop a game can be as little as 2-3 months.** ### 🎉 **There's a Solution!** We work with these unfinished/abandoned games and we’re able to acquire/ receive **a share of these projects**, while **partnering with the original developer** who is usually **glad to work together** just to see their vision come to life. This gives us a much bigger market of unfinished games to acquire and mass **produce for faster and cheaper.** Meanwhile, the original developer gets to make money back from their idea at a fraction of the time and effort.\\ \\ Effectively - it’s the revenue of gaming with the predictability of B2B SaaS! ### 🤯 **What next?** Once at least a game takes off, it **proves the validity of it’s idea.** Then we can dedicate larger, longterm resources and grow the game’s IP exponentially, turning it into a **multimedia franchise (movies, toys, etc) building more revenue streams beyond the game.** ### 📊 **Our Stats & Games:** * **51,828,645** total play sessions * **84.6%** average like ratio * **497,554,992** hours of engagement (#roadto1B) * **190,608** daily active users * **331,595** favourites * **4** original games * **3** brand partnership games ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65554&key=user_uploads/1016774/a3806f6e-88a8-4d52-b9d5-a7e31b799d62) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65554&key=user_uploads/1016774/3f72a0a1-34b7-4448-9df1-77b690ad92b5) Thanks so much! \\ [tom@roforco.com](mailto:tom@roforco.com)\\ [roforco.com](http://roforco.com)",Artem 'Tom' Middleton,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/54fa591f2f38b1155fee3f0ef3b26322cd5a6601.jpg,Otherimage_27085_1.jpg;Otherimage_27085_2.jpg;,27085
Dev Tools AI 🤖 CoPilot for UI Testing,"# **TL;DR** [Dev Tools](https://www.dev-tools.ai/) is a library that makes it easy to write web tests in your existing framework by drawing a box over a screenshot instead of building a locator. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65540&key=user_uploads/1076464/6cf84e73-20ac-4ca5-994d-329f77e7b325) # **🤕Problem** Writing end to end tests is difficult and time consuming. It takes forever to dig into the page code to build the right XPath or locator. And even when these are found, they are likely to change over time as the product continues development. # **⚡️Our solution** We use computer vision to look at the screen, like an end user, and find the element you want to interact with. Then, in real-time, we find the element and return it so all your existing automation can keep working with it. We make this easy to use by extending Selenium with a `findByAI()` method where you just put a human readable name and let the AI do the hard work. We even let you see the elements from within your IDE! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65540&key=user_uploads/1076464/bb8100b8-b570-4aeb-8bae-fd49cd8d470d) # **🎉 Bonus Features** ### Work on Games Traditional automation has trouble working with games as most games render within a canvas element. Because we only use the screenshot, and not page source, we can play games like LooneyToons! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65540&key=user_uploads/1076464/3feb64e1-36cd-47c0-93f5-a8c3e98d10d1) ### Crawl for Errors Monkey Testing for errors comes standard with Android, but there isn’t a default one for Web. We added that functionality to our SDK so that you simply call `scan_domain()` and it will crawl your page and look for errors like broken links, 404s, console errors, etc. Learn more in our [blog](https://www.dev-tools.ai/blog/site-sacnner) about the feature. # **Our Ask - Try it out and give us feedback** If you write or have written Selenium or UI tests, we would love your feedback on the tool.

Chowdeck - The easiest and fastest way to deliver food in Africa,"Hi! My name is Femi Aluko, CEO of Chowdeck, an on-demand food delivery service in Nigeria founded in collaboration with my two friends, Olumide Ojo (CTO) and Lanre Yusuf (COO). Launched in October 2021, Chowdeck is Africa's easiest and fastest on-demand food delivery service. Our mission is to empower restaurants to deliver meals to customers anywhere and anytime. Today, we serve customers in two major neighbourhoods in Lagos, the largest city in Nigeria and the most populous in Africa. In the seven months since launch, we’ve achieved a record delivery time of under 30 minutes even as order volume increased from an average of 40 daily orders in January to an average of 650 daily orders in July. In addition, at least 88% of the 67 restaurants we partner with have recorded an increase in sales. Africa’s biggest economic hub still doesn't have an efficient on-demand food delivery for restaurants. We’re on a mission to fix this, starting in Lagos and soon throughout Africa. **Milestones** In the last six months, we’ve: * Done over 60,000 deliveries(did 17k in July) * processed over $500k in GMV($125k in July) * made $24k in monthly revenue in July * 3500+ active users (65% of whom have ordered more than once) **The Team** * Femi Aluko, former Backend Principal Engineer at Paystack (acquired by Stripe for over $200m) * Olumide Ojo, former Frontend Principal Engineer at Paystack (acquired by Stripe for over $200m) * Lanre Yusuf, former Engineering Lead at Crown Interactive. **Ask:** * If you live or work around Ikeja or Yaba in Lagos Nigeria, kindly try us out ❤️ * If you don’t live in Lagos or Nigeria, kindly follow us and support us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chowdeck) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chowdeck/).

Sinovia Technologies: ✨ Flexible Printed OLEDs,"Hi All! We are Whitney and George, and at [Sinovia Technologies](https://www.sinoviatech.com/) we make OLED displays for smart products using roll-to-roll printing. ### **🚧 The problem: smart products need to communicate data to their users, but there hasn’t been innovation in low cost displays in 50 years.** IoT products are built around the data that they collect, the functions they perform, and the data that they communicate back to their users. They are constrained by space, power, and cost, and these factors determine whether a product can include an indicator or display for user communication. The primary indicator options right now are based on LED and LCD technologies, which are bulky, power-hungry, and can only convey limited types of information. ### ✨ **The solution: printed OLED** OLED is the highest-quality display tech on the market, but until now it has been relegated to high-end phones and TVs because of cost. Sinovia's proprietary materials allow us to make printed OLEDs using the same old-school tools used to make labels, packaging, and newspapers. We make really nice displays very quickly and very cheaply.

"🔔 Raven - A single API for product notifications across SMS, Email, Push, WhatsApp, Slack & more","**TL;DR** Raven gives businesses a central platform to manage product notifications across SMS, Email, Push, WhatsApp, Slack & more. We do this by connecting 40+ providers like Twilio, SendGrid, Firebase with a single API and giving a central dashboard on top to design & monitor all notifications. ``` ``` **📝Book a demo** [**here**](https://calendly.com/priyanshs/platform-demo) **to learn more.** Hey everyone - We’re Priyansh and Sriyansh (yes, we are brothers!) and we would love to tell you about [Raven](https://www.raven.dev). ### 🚫THE PROBLEM Businesses spend a lot of resources managing product notifications (think due-date reminders or verification codes). For example to send a payment reminder via SMS, Email & WhatsApp, you have to integrate multiple provider APIs like Twilio, SendGrid, then orchestrate channels basis user preferences and finally send the correct template on-time. The problem is - * Since each notification has it’s own set of templates & configurations, it becomes complex & time consuming to make any changes. * There’s no central visibility as the data is spread across multiple messaging providers. It is a pain for product teams to pull it from 5-6 diff sources, standardize and then analyze them. * Ensuring deliverability is a challenge. Some messages like OTPs are critical and their delivery failures lead to huge business losses. ### 🎁OUR SOLUTION A central platform that brings all your messaging channels & providers in one place, where you can orchestrate and analyze them - all without engineering. * A single API to send notifications across channels via any of the 40+ providers like Twilio, SES, Firebase, Messagebird, Gupshup. * A dashboard gives central visibility on all templates, logs & delivery metrics allowing product teams to optimize CX by analyzing what works and what doesn’t, reduce redundant messages and thereby saving tons of money. * Reduces business risk by effectively managing delivery failures using failovers/retries across channels & providers. ### ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65513&key=user_uploads/584996/91936c0b-0457-43f0-9746-5eee037fcebf) ### 💡WHY WE BUILT THIS We’ve previously built the notification infrastructure for Apna (India’s fastest unicorn) & OkCredit (YC S18), and didn’t want any other engineer to go through the same pain as we did. It was not only us, but companies like LinkedIn, Netflix, AirBnB spend $10s of millions/yr with a 10-30 member engineering & product team which just does notifications 🤯. ### 🤑 OFFER + ASK✨ 50% off first 3 months for startup community - email [founders@ravenapp.dev](mailto:founders@ravenapp.dev) to redeem **🥳 We’d love to talk to you -**  [**book a demo**](https://calendly.com/priyanshs/platform-demo) **with us today!**",Priyansh Srivastava,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/1077e68b458e299e40d385e644a977d5e3499cc3.jpg,Otherimage_26783_1.jpg;,26783
Shelf - Neobank for Young Professionals in India 🚀🚀,"Hi all! We’re Vedant & Paras Rajput, the founders of [Shelf](http://shelfpay.in/)! Shelf is a Neobank for Young Professionals in India. Instead of using four different apps for Banking, Payments, Expense Management & Bill Splitting, users can keep and manage their money on Shelf, and pay anywhere effortlessly. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/365732/54d561c6-d375-498a-90c0-66bbd9fba12c) ### **🚨The Problem:** **70% of the expenses made by Young Professionals are Shared!** People in the early stages of their career usually shift to the tier 1 & 2 cities of India where their companies are based. In these cities, they live with their friends in shared apartments and have a lot of common expenses such as → Rent, House-Help, Cook, Groceries, Online Food Ordering, Entertainment, Travel, and Utilities just to name a few. There are also a lot of alluring activities that they partake in with their friends & colleagues which just adds up to a big amount at the end of the month. In all these scenarios there is usually only one person who pays, then he/she tracks/splits the amount, then constantly asks for their money back (only to get it back after 2 months), and in the entire duration they suffer a dent which disrupts their monthly budget and there is almost negligible savings (Gosh! Even sounds painful). **The current banking system does not understand this!** ### **💡The Solution:** **⚡One-Stop Financial App for all the needs of Young Professionals⚡** As a Neobank, Shelf not only caters to your banking & payments needs, but we also help you manage your spending and pay as a group from the getgo! When you’re using Shelf, you need not have 4 different apps for banking, payments, tracking expenses, and splitting bills, you can just keep your money on Shelf and pay anywhere with a simple slide. We’re helping you: 1. Pay for only your share even in a group payment ✅ 2. Save more and have increased spending capacity ✅ 3. Reduce the Time and Effort needed for banking ✅ Yeah, Shelf gets you. It’s a Neobank for Young Professionals made by Young Professionals ;) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/365732/265fa696-b0c6-4a05-9a1f-65710f6a87d5) The products we are providing: * **Personal Shelf:** Budget what you’re gonna spend and where. * **Shared Shelf:** For common expenses with your friends * **Shelf Cards (launching soon):** A super card to serve all your payment-related needs (Interchangeable Group & Personal card) ### **👨‍💻 The Team:** Paras & I, are 2021 graduates from IIT Roorkee and have known each other since 2017.

Payable ⚡️ No-code Online Payments for Indonesia,"Hi everyone, we’re Faza, Gery, and Albert, aka the team behind Payable! ### 👋 Team Faza, Gery, and Albert were classmates back in Bandung Institute of Technology, #1 engineering school in Indonesia. We have been friends for almost 7 years and in early 2022, we started building Payable. Previously, Faza worked at BCG helping enterprises to build their own digital ventures. Gery worked at Shopee Singapore as a Tech Lead, building robust systems at scale handling >1 million QPS. He even managed two PhDs in his team even though he is a bachelor’s graduate. Albert worked at L’Oreal, the biggest beauty company in the world to set up their social commerce business in Indonesia and grew it by 10x. During his time in L’Oreal, Albert realized how effective it is when beauty advisers sell products directly in WhatsApp, but it’s also very apparent how bad the payment infrastructure is (non-existent, actually). This led us to realize how massive the problem is, and how uniquely qualified we are to help solve it. ### **❌** Problem In Indonesia, online commerce is a really big thing, but almost half of those don’t happen on e-commerce sites, but rather they happen on apps such as WhatsApp, Instagram, Line, etc. Here, the payment infrastructure is basically non-existent. Everyone is still using bank transfers which create a huge pain for sellers because they have to spend hours manually reconciling hundreds of transfers every day. This also hurts the buyer’s experience since they have a very limited range of payment options. ### ⚡️ Meet Payable There are actually a number of existing online payment solutions in Indonesia, but all of them are too expensive and too hard to use for these small and medium sellers, hence they are stuck to doing manual bank transfers. But with Payable, we’re providing them with an online payment infrastructure that is 6x cheaper and much easier to use compared to the existing solutions. ### ⚙️ How it Works With Payable, sellers can easily create payment links, and send it to their customers via WhatsApp, Instagram, or other chatting apps. Their buyers can open the link and pay with various payment methods. After the payment is done, the seller will instantly get a notification and it’s all reconciled automatically. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/205368/003301ce-766c-4f7c-a847-b056ad83f4ad) ### 🙏 Our Ask If you know anyone who is selling stuff through WhatsApp or Instagram in Indonesia, we’d love to learn about their use case!

⚡️Instant: The Modern Firebase,"Hello hello! We’re [Stopa](https://stopa.io) and [Joe](http://www.joeaverbukh.com/), and we’re excited to share [Instant](https://instantdb.com)! Instant is the graph-based successor to Firebase. We make it easy to build realtime and collaborative applications like Figma or Notion. **Some quick context on us:** We have 15 years of technical experience between the two of us. We both worked at Facebook and Airbnb as senior and staff engineers. It was at Facebook we saw how a graph-based solution with an expressive permission layer allowed engineers to ship fast and at scale. We want to bring the same experience to all developers around the world. Some people think realtime and collaboration are nice-to-haves, and place it at the bottom of their to-implement list. But if you think about it, multiplayer experiences are what separates the good apps from the best. It’s why Notion beats Evernote, and why Figma beats Sketch. Features like realtime, collaboration, offline mode, and optimistic updates will be table stakes for applications of the future. At present though, implementing these features is difficult due to edge cases and added complexity. Only a few products offer great multiplayer experiences, and these are usually bespoke solutions from a team of engineers at top-tech companies. Instant handles this complexity for you via a graph-based database on the client + an expressive permissions layer. This gives you a Firebase-like experience AND support for relationships between data. This combination provides multiplayer out of the box and enables developers to move fast. It’s still early days, we have much to build. We’re currently free to use and will roll out paid plans in the future. **You can already start building with Instant today at** [**https://instantdb.com**](https://instantdb.com) If you sign up, we’ll personally reach out and answer any questions you have with building on Instant.

Cambio 🏗️🌎🚀 Decarbonizing commercial real estate at scale,"Hi! We’re Steph and Leia, co-founders of Cambio. **Problem** Buildings drive 40% of the world’s carbon emissions. The need for the commercial real estate industry to achieve net zero emissions has never been stronger, as 60% of the Fortune 500 has issued climate pledges and 50 municipalities have mandated building emissions reductions.  **Need** Yet today’s approach to implement sustainability across real estate portfolios is broken. Teams rely on manual, expensive and fragmented consultant engagements, requiring thousands of team hours and millions of dollars in upfront cost, just to know where to take action across the portfolio. After years of manually hunting down utility data, sifting through static 100-page reports and building one-off financial models for every building in the portfolio, real estate managers are desperate for a better way.     **Enter Cambio** We’ve lived this painful user journey. That’s why we’re building Cambio - to disrupt and automate this process. We help commercial landlords and corporate tenants measure the carbon footprint of their buildings and identify high-impact retrofits that drive both cost savings and decarbonization. Cambio ingests building data to provide the optimal path to net zero at both the portfolio level and individual building level. **Backstory** We met as roommates at Stanford while pursuing our MBAs and MS in the Sustainable Built Environment. On move-in day, we discovered we both worked in commercial real estate and joked over a glass of wine that we should team up to start a company together. The rest is history!  We’re building the solution we wished we had across our fourteen years working at leading commercial real estate players like KKR, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Oxford Properties.  We’ve lived the pain point and are ready to deliver our solution to the market. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65456&key=user_uploads/1069893/dba9f65f-e767-41e8-aaa3-5d34a3956fe2) **The Ask** We’re rapidly growing our technical team (SWE, Data Engineering, Data Scientist) and also looking for warm intros to any company who wants to make their real estate footprint more sustainable.

🧠 Pathspace: Collaborative brainstorming. Supercharged with A.I.,"Hey! Super thrilled to share Pathspace with all of you!

Most group brainstorming involves a few people throwing out ideas. Then, a team leader guesses consensus and prioritizes. **This typical brainstorming process is far from ideal and has the following flaws:** 1. **Single-threaded** - With only one person talking at a time, there is a single train of thought, and many good ideas are left unsaid and unexplored 2. **Groupthink** - The desire for quick decisions and group cohesion can make bad decisions seemingly unanimous 3. **Controlled by Leaders and Extroverts** - The loudest team members or those with the most authority can drown out the opinions of the more introverted and junior team members. 4. **Self-censorship** - Fear of judgment and social anxiety can cause some members to withhold crazier ideas. 5. **Poor engagement** - Doing nothing and waiting for the meeting to end passively is easy, especially remotely. — ### **✅ The Solution** We created a brainstorming tool for remote teams with built-in design thinking best practices from expert facilitators. It’s a quick, customizable step-by-step process to unleash your team's creativity and prioritize. **Pathspace is easier to use than a “digital whiteboard” and more robust than a doc:** 1. **Structured and intuitive** - Rather than a single generic interface like a doc or whiteboard, each step in the process has a unique user interface. 2. **AI suggestions** - Leverage the power of GPT-3 to generate more out-of-the-box ideas. 3. **Anonymous (no groupthink)** - Discover the best ideas and reach a democratic consensus with anonymous ideas and voting. 4. **Organized and exportable** - Instead of scattered stickies that are hard to parse, we automatically keep everything organized so you can easily understand results and export them. 5. **Customizable** - Create and customize Pathspace to your process by mixing and matching different tactics. ![](https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62d313720e07abf87ece7618/62df4aafd1d3f877f7a7d04d_Step%205.png) — ### **Brainstorm for free.

Juicebox 🧃 Zero-commission marketplace for independent talent,"Hey there 👋 We’re [David](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-paffenholz/) and [Ishan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishan-gupta-7203a91a3/), co-founders of [Juicebox](https://www.juicebox.work/)! **TL;DR:** Juicebox is a zero-commission marketplace to hire independent tech talent. Companies get subscription-based access to vetted talent; independents get the opportunity to grow their business without relying on an agency 🥥 ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/705094/7db7545e-10d5-44e3-b28c-f7d0d68b2184) ### 🤯 **The Problem: hiring independents is hard** We’ve been freelancers, and we’ve hired freelancers. And we know it’s tough. When looking for high-skilled independent contractors, companies are either faced with substantial markups (30% to 70%+) or hundreds of applications to scour through. For startups like us, that’s time and money better spent building! And for independents, it adds an intermediary to what should be a direct relationship with a business. ### 🤝 **The Solution: subscription-based pricing & vetted talent** Instead of charging a commission on every transaction, Juicebox has a transparent, monthly fee — charged to the business. Just like SaaS! This has major benefits for both sides: * Companies pay less and can plan easily. There’s no middle man taking 50% of every transaction. * Independents can set their own prices, work with clients directly, and get contacted by vetted companies, only. And this is just the first step in our mission to **make independent work the better way to work.** ### **Sounds interesting? 🧃** 💫 **Independents** —> apply to [**join**](https://www.juicebox.work/independents-sign-up) our community 🔮 **Businesses** —> [**find**](https://www.juicebox.work/) the best independent talent If you want to chat about partnerships, have questions, or anything else, shoot us a note at [founders@juicebox.work](mailto:founders@juicebox.work)",David Paffenholz,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c2c83e761d3b7bd5cb9d786b29abd744e88ce259.jpg,Otherimage_26800_1.jpg;,26800

🌊 Ajourney - Gusto for South East Asia (SEA),"Hi YC! We’re [Jonathan](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/878905), [Thomas](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/981080) and [Cayter](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/1005416). [**Ajourney**](https://ajourney.io) **is building Gusto for South East Asia (SEA).** ### The Problem Running payroll is a very repetitive activity. We’ve identified 3 areas that can be better. First, most payroll software in SEA act as a calculator to calculate compliance contributions but do not automate the other aspects of running a payroll such as: * Collection of attendance or commissions data for salary computation * Handling payments through bank and government portals Second, hiring of remote contractors in SEA is increasing with greater adoption of remote working tools for small businesses. Manual payments have to be made separately from payroll. Third, businesses growing regionally in SEA usually outsource payroll as they do not want to build internal competency in payroll compliance for every market. ### Our Approach Ajourney helps businesses to manage their payroll end-to-end from data collection to disbursements, compliance filings and payments. We reduce repetitiveness and time spent on payroll through integrations and workflow automation. Besides software, we offer customer support to help companies on their payroll compliance needs. Customers can enjoy the benefits of both in-sourced payroll and outsourced payroll through a single offering. We are currently building our product for the Singapore market and will expand to more markets at a later date. ![](https://ajourney.io/images/landing-page-payroll-9b16a6258953508db851b28b694af76a.png?vsn=d) ## Our Team We are 3 technical co-founders and can relate to the problem well because of previous pains we have experienced. I previously co-founded a groceries delivery startup in SEA. Payroll was messy - we outsourced and always had difficulty getting a consolidated view across markets. Thomas worked with small medium businesses in a previous startup and saw the struggles of business owners running payroll manually on spreadsheets. Cayter has wide exposure into payments and has seen the challenges and costs in handling payments across borders. ### Our Asks If you: \\- Are based in Singapore \\- and/or hire contractors remotely \\- and/or have expanded regionally We’ll love to speak to you to understand how you are handling your payroll.

Chat with him about #javaScript #mongoDB #boardGames or #parkour # Isn’t invoice digitization a solved problem? Why should I care about it? Well, no. The first time we approached this problem we thought the same thing, but it really isn’t. Most commercial solutions rely on one of two approaches: * Template based AI. Basically, you need to pre-configure how to extract information from every different invoice layout you might need to process. It clearly doesn’t scale, it is expensive to setup, and really expensive to maintain. * Outsourcing. Meaning someone, somewhere, is going to have to take a look at your invoices. Humans take a long time to do it, and on top of that they make mistakes. Every year 100+ billion invoices are issued in the USA and EU, wasting tens of billions of dollars in errors and unproductive costs. Invofox allows you to automate all of the processes taking place around invoices, such as payments or accounting, without anyone having to review those documents. We do this with an easy to use, stripe like, [API](https://prod.kinequo.com/backends/midas/api-docs/), that allows software companies to seemlessly integrate our technology into their product and provide the best possible service to their customers. ### **Our ask** 1.

Hero: Bill.com for Latam,"Hey YC 👋 Alvaro and Fernando from @Hero here! **Hero is Bill for Latam.**  **98 SMBs use our corporate cards and WhatsApp bot to organize their expenses.** ### **Companies without Hero** When people spend on behalf of their company, they have to **save those receipts**. Some get lost, some get erased, and some become a source of questioning. What was that receipt for? Eventually someone makes a **spreadsheet**, **prints** it out, and staples it to corresponding receipts. His/her boss approves these by **signing** with a **pen**. Later on, an accountant **transcribes** these into some sort of **accounting** software. It takes months for decision makers in the company to know how much they are really spending. ### **Companies with Hero** An employee uses his/her **Hero Card** to make a purchase. He/she immediately receives a **WhatsApp** message from our bot, asking for a **picture** of the receipt. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65394&key=user_uploads/376933/c4c4b771-3bc0-4bf6-835d-7e7955e40181) Users use our **webapp** to create **reports** and manage **reimbursements**.\\ All expenses go through Hero’s **OCR engine.** Accountants use our webapp to **export** expense information to their **accounting** **software** of choice. Decision makers see in realtime how much their company is spending. ### **Why We Built This** Alvaro was managing the expenses for a remote company. Employees would send him pictures of receipts via WhatsApp along with a typed out table, asking for reimbursement.  We hacked away a no-front-end version that saved Alvaro 2 hours per week. We eventually polished the product and started selling it. # **How can you help us?** If you’re in Latam and you spend time reporting expenses or dealing with receipts, reach out to us!

Bridgecard 💳 The card issuer for Africa,"Hello 👋, we are Tunde and Festus, the founders of [Bridgecard](https://issuecards.bridgecard.co). **The problem 😓:** Data has become affordable in most parts of Africa, for example, the price of mobile data has dropped by over 75% in Nigeria over the past 5 years. Local people have started consuming global services like Netflix, AWS, AliExpress, Udemy, etc. but don’t have a card to pay for these services. Local banks in Africa haven’t been able to support international transactions on the local currency cards. I traveled to the US for the first time 2 months ago and almost got stranded at the airport because I found out that Uber in SanFrancisco does not accept cash and my local bank card didn’t work. I was able to hack together a card, add it to the app, and Uber down to my location. **Our Solution 💳:** [Bridgecard](https://issuecards.bridgecard.co) makes it easy for any fintech company to issue their customers a card that will carry a MasterCard or Visa logo and work anywhere in the world. We provide easy-to-integrate APIs to issue virtual and physical cards and we can get you started in 5 days or less. My co-founder and I got into YC to build something different but our previous card issuer stopped supporting over 20 other companies and us in Nigeria alone so we couldn’t keep our product in the market. We woke up one morning and decided to be the card issuer ourselves. **Ask 🤝:** If you’re building a fintech product and you need to issue cards in Africa, check out [Bridgecard](https://issuecards.bridgecard.co) or send me a mail at [tunde@bridgecard.co](mailto:tunde@bridgecard.co).

Pivo - Bank Accounts and Payments for Freight Carriers in Africa,"**The Problem** SMEs in supply chains are constantly battling cash flow problems. These SMEs do not get paid in advance and have narrow windows (2 to 7 days) to execute orders. Yet their invoices take as long as 90 days to pay. This is further compounded by an inefficient way to track how and when they get paid. They are left struggling to execute large client orders and miss out on significant business opportunities and earnings.   **The Pivo Solution** Starting with freight carriers, Pivo provides easy access to a smart bank account, debit card and digital invoicing tools that track payments so they can get paid faster.  ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65366&key=user_uploads/147283/c94afb6e-46c0-424c-9633-9c94b17b6364) This will be further augmented by more fundamental financial products such as access to credit and expense management, to improve cash flow for these SMEs.  Our goal is to build an end-to-end financial operating system for these businesses.   **Our Ask**  Know any supply chain companies or tech platforms looking for a smart financial partner for their SME vendors?

💡Illuminant Surgical: Safer surgeries by projecting guidance directly on the patient's skin,"💫 Hello! We’re [Eldrick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eldrickm/) and [James](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameshu7/), the co-founders of [Illuminant Surgical](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/illuminant-surgical). Illuminant is helping surgeons perform **safer and more efficient surgeries by projecting visual guidance directly on the patient’s skin**. We can display patient specific anatomy, annotations, and real-time feedback as a surgeon operates. ### **❌ Modern Surgical Care Needs Modern Tools:** Surgeons use techniques from intuition to live x-rays to figure out where to go in the human body during a surgery. James’s experience in the operating room allowed him to see that clinical intuition, though important, was too often used to justify poor surgical approximations. Guessing and checking comes at the cost of patient health. As health care systems are demanding better outcomes, surgeons are driven to find technologies that can enhance their accuracy and increase their situational awareness to better serve their patients. ### **💡 We’re Building for The Future of Surgery:** One of the many features of our first product allows surgeons to visualize deep internal anatomy taken from the patient’s medical imaging (e.g. CT, MRI) and surgical tool trajectories directly on the patient’s skin, which opens up a new class of minimally invasive techniques in spine surgery. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/636938/db2788a9-91bb-4713-a473-ef1746e2e209) Most importantly, our new class of surgical navigation systems addresses three critical needs: 1. **Clinical Need**: We aim to raise the standard of care and decrease patient complications by giving surgeons important information within their line of sight during critical moments in surgery. 2. **Market Need**: The Illuminant system is cost effective, allowing us to scale beyond high volume care centers and high dollar procedures. Our software-defined approach allows us to support many different types of surgeries. We’re starting with spinal procedures, a $3B+ market with a clear regulatory and reimbursement pathway. 3. **User Need:** Our system is designed for frictionless use for the care team. It eliminates unnecessary pieces of hardware, is quick and easy to set-up, and is intuitive to use. ### **🥽 Who We Are:** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/636938/54efb45d-6f24-43f8-be30-893465e4f1a3) James and Eldrick were freshman dormmates at Stanford, where they both studied engineering. After school, Eldrick led hardware-software projects and teams as the first employee at a now-Series A lidar startup. James completed biodesign training and went to medical school before leaving in his final year to found Illuminant. In our early conversations, the same question kept coming up: if we have cars on the cusp of being able to drive themselves, why can’t that technology be used to help surgeons navigate the human body? With our team’s backgrounds in medicine, 3D sensing, computer vision, and hardware development, we realized we could make it happen. ### **🤲 How You Can Help:** 1. **Are you interested in piloting our device?**  If you are/or know a neurological or orthopedic spine surgeon, reach out to us to pilot our device! We’re offering hands-on demos. 2. **Could you introduce us to one health system administrator/decision maker?** **Reach out to us at** [**founders@illuminant.ai**](mailto:founders@illuminant.ai)**!

Provision 🏗️📃 - Ironclad for construction,"We’re Brendan and Luigi and we’re the co-founders of Provision. **Problem**\\ The construction industry spends $500B annually (\\~4% of market value) on issues stemming from document complexity.

Brendan left the industry, and built two startups over a couple of years but always had aspirations to go back to construction. Luigi worked as a Director at an infrastructure developer for 6 years, where he saw even the most sophisticated constructors fail to understand their documents.

Trebu is a data sharing network to help companies in LATAM fight fraud and default.,"### Our customers can access real-time information and use it to strengthen their credit models, while keeping control of their data. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1046279/f30a1d00-91f1-4c9f-b600-6f55271653b9) ### **What is the problem?** \\- High default rates make it harder to build sustainable lending companies without relying on increasing interest rates. \\- High interest rates lead to low retention. \\- Many of the same borrowers who are defaulting with one lending company, are also defaulting with others.  \\- Borrowers are taking out multiple loans from various lenders in order to repay other loans. \\- Borrowers take out loans to repay other loans and get larger loan amounts, which leads to customer indebtedness. **What is our solution?** * A data sharing network for digital lending companies to reduce fraud and default. * Our customers can access real-time information and use it to strengthen their credit models, while keeping control of their data. **Backstory** After giving over 2 million loans as the general managers of Tala and Branch in Mexico, Daniel and Fran realized that many of the same borrowers who were defaulting with one company were also defaulting with the other, shedding light on the high risk of the market. Using the existing alternatives to underwrite is not enough as they are expensive and data is not recent enough to detect common risks. To change this, they partnered with Antonio to build Trebu. **Asks** Intros to anyone in risk and credit teams!!

We provide APIs, dashboard and regulatory support for developers to build, embed and launch banking products.** Check out our documentation [here](https://docs.getanchor.co/reference/overview) & request invite [here](https://airtable.com/shr4yvnnM9obXKhVe).

Finito - Quit smoking in 4 weeks with a self-hypnosis app,"**tl;dr:** Hypnotherapy makes smokers [10x more likely](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8881046_Clinical_Hypnosis_For_Smoking_Cessation_Preliminary_Results_of_a_Three-Session_Intervention) to quit smoking than going it alone and can be [more effective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229913002100) than nicotine replacement therapy. We’ve created Finito, a self-hypnosis app that helps people quit with 15-minute daily sessions, educational readings, and stop-craving tools. Check out the app on [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finito-quit-smoking-hypnosis/id1624855382?platform=iphone) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mindsethealth.quit)!

It’s responsible for 1 in 5 deaths and an economic cost of more than [$300 billion a year in the US](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm) alone. While half of smokers made a quit attempt in the past year, research shows it may take up to 30 attempts before they are successful. This is because nicotine patches and gums do not address the emotional and habitual factors behind smoking and access to in-person therapeutic support is limited. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/243817/d8b07f51-9847-4ee2-bcf6-f1e3055e45b8) **✨ Our solution** We’ve joined up with world-leading neuroscientist Dr Gary Elkins to create an easy-to-use app with a 4-week structured program that helps people quit smoking with 15-minute daily self-hypnosis sessions, educational readings, and stop-craving tools. What distinguishes Finito from other smoking cessation solutions is that it addresses the underlying reasons that cause people to smoke in the first place, providing hypnotic suggestions to the subconscious to manage cravings, emotions, and habits. The program is ideal for people who have tried to quit but have returned to smoking because it changes their unconscious smoking behavior and gives them the tools to self-manage their craving symptoms. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/243817/95ead0b3-6059-4073-934b-5e984df16299) **⚙️ How it works** You may be familiar with hypnosis and its urban-legendary ability to help people stop smoking. Well, clinical studies show that hypnotherapy can actually be [10 times more effective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14768970/) than quitting without support and [more effective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229913002100) than nicotine replacement therapy. And according to [neurobiological brain studies](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/27/8/4083/3056452?login=false), hypnotherapy activates areas of the [brain associated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25365127/) with attention, motivation, and a sense of well-being. Hypnosis isn't a therapy itself - it's a state of focused attention and heightened suggestibility that makes therapeutic techniques like CBT and guided imagery more effective. Hypnotherapy is like meditation but focused on health outcomes **💙 Founders backstory** We created Mindset Health to empower people to improve their health by unlocking the power of their mind. We’ve already helped 80,000 people manage their IBS with hypnotherapy with our app Nerva. And we’re really excited to help people finally quit smoking, many of whom are understandably anxious and depressed about a habit that has controlled their life for too long. **Our ask** 1.

EthosX: Decentralized finance platform for crypto & traditional derivatives,"Hi all, we are [Smit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smit-patoliya/) & [Deepanshu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepanshu1/) and we are super stoked to announce EthosX! ### ### 🚀TL;DR   EthosX makes it easy for crypto companies and financial institutions to sell on-chain derivatives to their customers and trade with each other. For example, using EthosX’s options infrastructure two hedge funds can trade high-value on-chain options with each other directly without involving any banks or brokers with zero counterparty risk and zero settlement risk.   ### ❓Problem   **Global derivatives ecosystem is broken.** Derivatives trading in traditional finance has way too many gatekeepers and intermediaries. This leads to inefficiencies and things falling apart every other day. As insiders, we have seen how much everything hangs by a thread. With **USD 600 Trillion dollars (notional value) at stake**, one would expect things to be better, but they aren’t. Crypto was supposed to be free of these issues and a solution to all of this, but it is itself getting more and more centralized with disastrous consequences, as was clearly evident in the last few months. With every other crypto exchange/bank running away with user’s funds, one can hardly blame the users/traders/investors if they don’t trust centralized entities for complex products like derivatives. ### 🎯Solution   We are bringing the entire derivative trading lifecycle on blockchains end-to-end (trading, clearing and settlement). Institutions can trade directly with each other on-chain via smart contracts created by us without involving any banks, brokers or exchanges. These trades have zero counterparty risk as the net payoffs are locked in the code. The settlement of these derivatives is automatic and done with the help of on-chain oracles and therefore the settlement risk is also zero.  We are also adding a Request-For-Quote system which will help bring more liquidity to these trades. Now, due to regulatory and technical reasons, this cannot be done yet for traditional finance derivatives, so we are starting with cryptocurrency derivatives first and will eventually go towards traditional finance as well. We are providing derivatives infrastructure to other crypto companies as well who want to use these products as a part of a larger package to their customers. E.g. DeFi lending protocols can offer liquidation protection to their borrowers using our solutions. We have also created perpetual options which are live (testnet) on our website and can be traded by retail traders and institutions alike. The instructions to trade them are [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7wovngMr1uo6ZpBB_1fSluC1bLJnq5DK).    ### 📒Backstory Together we have spent nearly 15 years in quantitative finance and have seen, very closely, all the points where the derivatives ecosystem falls apart. Deepanshu was a Vice President at the Quantitative Research team of JP Morgan Chase and Smit was working at a quantitative hedge fund trading options before they came together again for EthosX. **It is kind of an open secret that blockchain tech can potentially eliminate many of the issues in derivatives life-cycle which have persisted for years/decades.**  ‘ # 💁How can you help   1. If you are at a financial institution and want to understand how large derivative trades can be done on-chain with no settlement risk and zero counterparty risk, please reach out to us at [contact@ethosx.xyz](mailto:contact@ethosx.xyz) or directly [message us on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepanshu1/) 2. If you are at a crypto company/protocol and need to use crypto derivatives for hedging your treasury or offering some price-volatility-protection to your customers, we will be happy to help!

Lumo 🏬 - Residential building manager in Europe with automated operations,"Hey everyone 👋 We’re [Miquel](https://linkedin.com/in/mllob) and [Dani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcarmonaserrat), co-founders of [Lumo](https://www.lumo.homes/). > Lumo is a Residential Building manager in Europe with automated operations. > > In Europe, if you own an apartment in a building you are probably part of a Homeowners’s Association (HOA). HOAs hire building managers to take care of operations, accounting and taxes. ### **What’s wrong with building managers?** The average experience for apartment owners is very poor. Managers are traditional small businesses using little technology, resulting in slow response times to incidents and low transparency. It’s a local, fragmented industry with no differentiation, and buildings stay very long with their existing managers for lack of a better option. What’s worse, because managers spend a lot of time working on tedious, repetitive tasks, they have less time to find improvement opportunities for the buildings they manage such as government subsidies for renovations, solar projects, cost savings, etc. It’s more like “keeping the lights on” and less like coaching the team to do better. ### **How is Lumo different?** By automating back-office operations like accounting, taxes and incident management, Lumo is able to provide buildings with fast response as well as real time information of their building, allowing them to understand their real expenses and the status of their requests. Thanks to technology, we are able to scale the business, which allows us to negotiate with service providers of the buildings, increasing service quality and saving owners money. ### **Founders** Miquel and Dani are technical co-founders (CS and Aerospace) from the top engineering school in Spain. Miquel was previously a Product Manager at Youtube where he launched Shopping on Youtube. Prior to that he was a PM at Skyscanner. He also founded the largest student hackathon in Europe with 1600 participants per year. Dani previously founded a software import business with $5M in annual sales where he automated a heavily manual cross border tax and accounting operation - very similar to what Lumo is automating. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65268&key=user_uploads/62977/d845787d-4f8b-4e0a-bb59-77a22f42a6ed) ### **Our Ask** **Are you an apartment owner in Europe?** We’d love to hear about your experience with your building manager.

Sytex - Project management for telecom and distributed projects,"**Hi! we're Sytex, and we want everyone to have great connectivity, anywhere in the world.** Technology-deploying industries, like telecom, manage thousands of activities, field crews, documentation, and materials, all in parallel. For project teams, it's nearly impossible to keep up to date with everything that happens while executing, and that's where excel files start flying around. Large companies have corporate platforms in place, but mainly to please the necessary management reports.

PayO - accounting and payment app for wholesalers and distributors in India,"Hi, we are Ashish and Pratik, founders of PayO. We are on a mission to help businesses to manage their finance better and collect payments faster. Check out the PayO app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=money.payo.m). **What is the Problem?** In India, B2B wholesalers and distributors with annual revenue of $100k - $1Mn still manage their finances on pen-paper.  They send paper invoices to customers, manage receivables in notebooks, and have to do multiple follow-ups with their customers to collect payments. They even have to send a staff member to their customer’s location- in order for them to collect a bank check for the payment on invoices. Existing solutions require businesses to be tech-savvy, signup with a payment gateway, and cannot be used on a smartphone. **Our Solution** PayO is an app that allows businesses to manage invoicing, payments and inventory. The app can also send payment reminders and links via any messaging channel like Whatsapp or SMS.  Businesses can even set automated payment reminders to their customers on the due date of the invoices. This saves countless hours, effort, and money spent on payment collections. For example, a pharmacy wholesaler who sells to hundreds of retailers uses PayO to send invoices and collect payments. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65224&key=user_uploads/513633/ca78ac88-fbc5-4dee-bd0b-b647542b526e) \\ **How it works** Businesses can get started simply by signing up on PayO with their mobile number. Once they’ve added their business details, they can create invoices, and share payment links with their customers. Further, they can manage their inventory. In addition, businesses can set automated payment reminders to be sent to their customers when the invoices are overdue. Users can track live payment statuses of their invoices and get money in their bank accounts faster than ever before. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65224&key=user_uploads/513633/0e458bbe-721d-492c-bb64-1e1da001a1c6) **Our Ask** 1.

Companies rely on old compensation survey data, which are updated only once every year. The salary expectations of candidates in the market change significantly on a quarterly basis (**_\\~7% statistically_**) in the startup ecosystem. This results in more than 50% of qualified/selected candidates not joining the company due to expectation mismatch. ### [**🤩**](https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%A4%A9/) **The Solution** [HireSure.ai](http://HireSure.ai) is an API-driven compensation benchmarking tool. We integrate with your existing HR/payroll systems, removing the need for manual data entry, and also **getting updated in real-time**. \\ [HireSure.ai](http://HireSure.ai) provides the most accurate real-time compensation benchmarking data which helps you **make the right offer** to the candidate. The platform allows you to communicate your offer to the candidate in the **most presentable and engaging manner**. It also uses behavior signals to **predict a potential dropout** in order to make course-correction to retain them. \\ This has the following advantages : * All the process of compensation **data submission is automatic** and needs no manual intervention * Since the job market is dynamic in nature, the offers made on [HireSure.ai](http://HireSure.ai)’s **real-time benchmarks** would be the most efficient * The presentation of the offer to the candidate makes it look **more appealing** and **explanatory** to the candidate * **Predicting a potential dropout** help companies put focused efforts into retaining the candidate ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/858890/d144ffa8-0f31-4014-b66a-4db7dd8c228c) ### [**🤩**](https://emojipedia.org/emoji/%F0%9F%A4%A9/) **The Ask** * **Warm introductions to Indian startups** (above 100 employees ) for a product demo * If you wish to know more or have any feedback (especially negative), we would be very happy to get in touch [anurag@hiresure.ai](mailto:anurag@hiresure.ai) ### **😀 The Deal** * All Indian YC companies that sign up by Sep’22 shall be getting compensation benchmarks **for free** (make sure you have this data before appraisals [🤭](https://emojis.wiki/face-with-hand-over-mouth/)).\\ Reach out to me at [anurag@hiresure.ai](mailto:anurag@hiresure.ai) or [Sign Up Here](https://www.hiresure.ai/about/contact)",Anurag Dixit,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/9a8f6f7d11e89b8796e5b4bc92a5d552ae9e7b30.jpg,Otherimage_27090_1.jpg;,27090
🪄 Levers — Automating accounting and financial insights for startups in MENA,"Hello everyone 👋 [Motasim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/motasim-zawawi-0a6b78b2/), [Ammar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ammaralkhouli/), and [Abdullah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhroot/) here, the co-founders of Levers. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65206&key=user_uploads/778737/ac67e6dd-c06d-47e1-9f04-3bca0e89d9cf) ### ### 🤔 **Why is accounting an issue for founders** The traditional accounting process remains highly manual, and the current solutions out there are poorly-suited for the needs of startups and small businesses. Founders often suffer from inadequate quality, high associated cost, or unresponsive providers –or they end up doing it themselves, taking away valuable bandwidth and requiring accounting expertise. What’s worse is that lack of proper financial foundation compounds quickly, impeding other aspects of a business. Founders often lack immediate access to the granular information they need to make critical business decisions or plan for the future –such as runway, unit economics, historical performance, or financial obligations. A needless amount of time is also spent putting together reports for shareholders, investors, auditors, or other stakeholders. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65206&key=user_uploads/778737/ad49f63d-13a1-473e-b008-76cf807e2710) ### 💡 **What Levers does for startups** Levers provides startups and small businesses with a dedicated accounting team, delivering accurate monthly books and financial reports –at a fraction of the cost! Startups get an intuitive, consumerized platform to manage their finances, monitor key metrics in real-time, stay on top of regulatory deadlines, and generate reports for stakeholders with a click of a button. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65206&key=user_uploads/778737/6fba901c-3539-4cc8-bec3-a74625b40672) \\ By automating manual and repetitive accounting tasks, we are able to reduce the associated time and cost while increasing accuracy of outputs. We integrate with the tools you use (e.g. banks, POSes, payment processors, etc) to unify fragmented company data on a single platform. Depending on your stage, we can run your financial back-office end-to-end, or supercharge your existing finance team by freeing them up to take on more complex, strategic initiatives. ### ⚙️ **How It Works** 1\\. Schedule an on-boarding call with your dedicated team 2\\. Connect your financial accounts 3\\. We do our magic ### 🧑‍💻 **Founder Backstory** My co-founders and I have all experienced the pains associated with running the financial back-office in previous roles. We understand that such tasks can drain founders of the creativity and resources they need to do what they do best: build and grow their business. This is what drove us to build Levers. \\ Our founding team has strong technology and finance expertise. Our Lead Accountant [Ahmed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahazzazi/) worked at Deloitte for 3 years as an auditor and analyzed transactions worth more than 100 million SAR, while conducting compliance reviews of internal controls. Abdullah was a founding engineer at Lean, a sequoia-backed Plaid for MENA, and a software engineer at the Saudi Stock Exchange. Ammar spent \\~3 years at a $500m VC fund in MENA and previously managed accounting, auditing, and financial reporting in various capacities. He has a Bachelor’s degree in Math and Philosophy from Yale. Motasim was most recently a product manager at a data products company and built an AML/KYC SaaS solution from scratch and received his Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford. ### 🙏 **Our Ask** 1\\.

Cerrion ⚡️ Computer Vision to automatically detect problems on production lines,"Hi everyone 👋 we are Karim, Nikolay and Michael, co-founders of [Cerrion](https://cerrion.com).\\ \\ We help production teams understand when, where and why losses are happening on their production lines. Enabling them to act on problems faster, implement targeted improvement actions and understand the root cause of problems in a matter of minutes. **The problem: Production teams today struggle to track and eliminate deviations on their production lines** Lack of transparency leads to around $1 trillion in annual preventable losses for the global manufacturing industry. Production teams today struggle to understand when losses on their production lines will happen and why they happen. To stay on top of your production a lot of trained and experienced eyes are needed. Given that today there is a 40% labor shortage in the US manufacturing industry alone, it is now more important than ever to help the existing workforce eliminate deviations on their production lines **The solution: Automatically monitor production lines for deviations** Our plug and play visual AI learns how a manufacturing process looks when things are going well and can automatically detect and track problems in real-time. This: \\- Eliminates the need for human monitoring;\\ \\-Allows to detect subtle issues on the production line  before they become big;\\ \\-Facilitates root cause analysis remotely and in a matter of minutes. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1001364/919f2fc1-c895-4acd-ad72-16c22c3d17fc) Our AI in action ^ **Can I deploy Cerrion in my production?**\\ Yes!

"🛠️ 🧠 Maya Labs : Build custom software in minutes, using natural language","Hi, we are Sibesh and Shubham, founders of Maya Labs. We are on a mission to teach machines how to code - starting off with a fast way to build internal tools in minutes using just natural language. Here’s an early look : ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65194&key=user_uploads/272578/a3e654bf-56a0-48e4-abeb-8922bc23b8b0) A longer 5-min demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPm0idKktzs) : Today, you can build one particular type of custom app well using Maya that let's you : 1. **Fetch custom data** : Configure setup + query custom data from an external source (currently we do SQL, Gsheets, Notion, Airtable etc, but are expanding fast) 2. **Visualize it** : Plot and visualize it in a custom table, line chart or bar graph 3. **Perform actions** : Select and act on a particular data item (send a custom email, upload a file, trigger an API, update a DB item) Maya incrementally generates programs & shows results in response to steps you type in English, so the whole experience doesn’t feel like debugging someone else’s code. It’s possible to modify, delete & debug the natural language parts and Maya responds instantly - which makes it possible to hold and move around the _natural language program_ in your head. Checkout an early version of the docs [here](https://mayalabs.io/docs). We intend to keep it just one page long. There’s still a lot to figure out and we’re trying to nail the experience for this one narrow use case first. When this works, we’ll try to extend it to just about any task you can think of - web navigation, connecting APIs, platform robots, RPA, home automation. Here’s a [show reel](https://mayalabs.io/library) of what else you can build manually with Maya today. **Who is this for?** Most internal tool builders are used by developers to build software for others on the product/ops/growth/sales/data teams, but we think this is a way for the user of the tool to also be the creator. **How does this work?** We use a combination of conditional logic, neural search/classification, fine-tuned language models and template generation to make this work **predictably** and **reliably** in response to words you type/modify. We generate programs in a custom flow-based programming language that lets us express a wide range of behaviours with a smaller program length and visual DAGs. We also created our own benchmark to measure how well machines are at generating code (see our paper on this [here](https://blogs.mayalabs.io/benchmark)). **About us** : We met in college many years back while starting Hyperloop India, the first Indian team at the SpaceX Hyperloop Competition - and have worked on-and-off on various projects since, sharing a common interest for hard engineering problems. Program synthesis is the hardest of them all - if software is eating the world, and you could build software that could build other software, why work on anything else? We’ve been tinkering on this for years. Many Python libraries, papers, toy environments and product iterations later, we think we finally have an angle of attack that has a chance of working. **Ask** : 1. Help us test our system! If you’d like to play around with or think someone in your team might benefit - send me a mail at sibesh\\[at\\]mayalabs\\[dot\\]io. 2. Improve Maya with useful data - Let me know if you think a particular kind of program pattern we could teach Maya would be useful for you and a wide variety of other similar users. 3. Introduce us to product/ops/growth/sales/data teams in your org who would like to build custom internal tools themselves without engineering effort 4. Hit me up to learn more about our approach!

🌆Landeed: Do you own your property in India? Are you sure? Let's check 🕵🏽,"**TL; DR We make it easy for real estate agents, owners, developers, bankers and legal advisors to instantly check property titles. Our Landeed** [**app**](https://www.landeed.com/) **retrieves government generated Encumbrance Certificate (EC) within seconds. This document summarizes all present and past transactions pertaining to a property going back multiple decades.** Namaste 🙏🏽 we are Jonathan, ZJ and Sanjay, the three musketeers fighting for your land rights. This is our second YC startup together and have known one another for 7 (lucky) years. ### **💀** **Serious Problem 🚨** Approximately 67% of all court cases in India deal with land-related disputes. This is due to India’s legal framework of “presumptive ownership.” Under this model, the due diligence on property purchases falls on the buyer with government claiming no responsibility. Furthermore, there is no concept of a single “title document” leading to prolonged due diligence phase ranging from 2-6 months whereas most property transactions in US can be concluded in 2-4 days. ### 🧪**Landeed Solution ⚡** Landeed is a national property title search engine. Use our [app](https://www.landeed.com/) and check property transaction ledger going back 20 years in 2 seconds. Think of it as “Google of real estate titles.” We built a standardized interface simplifying the multiple search methods across states into an intuitive and fluid user experience. Next up, Landeed for the world not just India! ### 🪄**Let’s talk about the magic 👏🏽** Landeed weaves together multiple government departments across various states producing a “plaid-like” property summary data. Whereas government platforms focus on taxing users for civic micro-services and document generation, our product is built around specific user profiles that have strong intent to transact. The end-result of this approach is a consumer-centric product with enterprise capabilities. Search property titles 10x faster guaranteed or money back ! (it’s free for YC) ### 🤵🏽**Damn I look good (the app)** 📲 ![landeed app encumbrance certificate screenshot 1](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/acf78d_f957a692fca24048b10ea00073c1a49a~mv2.png/v1/crop/x_736,y_180,w_1037,h_2120/fill/w_238,h_488,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/ec_details_portrait.png) ![landeed app encumbrance certificate screenshot 2](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/acf78d_92d55dce18e54a0e8c491f12cceb502a~mv2.png/v1/crop/x_731,y_171,w_1041,h_2128/fill/w_238,h_488,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/webview_portrait.png) 🗺️And yes, we support multiple states (Home court advantage: TS 🏏) 🙏🏽Asks 1. Download Landeed [app](https://www.landeed.com/) if you or anyone that you know have property in India 2. Request a state to launch if we are not currently covering it!

Although the main business is manufacturing, managing shipping logistics is an unnecessarily high-touch, highly manual overhead in the business’ day-to-day operations.\\ Additionally, Pradhith and I also got to experience the tedious logistics around importing products into India while we developed our previous business — an e-commerce retailer in India. Other companies that were suppliers to our e-commerce retailer also said they faced the same issues!\\ A lot of these issues have digitization and automation solutions, so it’s unnecessary that every importer/exporter has to manage logistics as a separate, highly-involved project in addition to their actual business. Our goal is to be the digital logistics partner that we wanted to partner with when we were running our previous business.",Vidhi Vakharia,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/780e45065bb366382a5c197f3df6d4e3dad99077.jpg,Otherimage_27190_1.jpg;Otherimage_27190_2.jpg;Otherimage_27190_3.jpg;Otherimage_27190_4.jpg;,27190

Kashin: The preferred financial app for the underbanked in Latam,"Hi everyone, we are **Kashin**, and our goal is to give access to financial products - not just bank accounts - to the informal economy in Latin America. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/586979/12f259f3-349a-432c-8f60-20424c451d9b) We serve users directly through our app. Our core product is a digital wallet, but we decided to start with the most difficult value-added product of all: Loans. The main issue behind lending in this segment is the high default rate - traditionally around 15%, and we have it below 8%. Our major disruption is our **collaborative credit algorithm** so that our users create their own social network of endorsers in our mobile app. The benefits improve according to the behavior of the user and his friends. Since many of our users are micro-entrepreneurs, we are developing our second product: a Soft-POS so that our users can receive credit and debit card payments immediately directly from our app without any initial cost. We have launched in Peru, but will soon expand to Colombia. We are currently a more than 50 people fully remote team with several nationalities, so we expect to serve several Latam countries soon. We are happy to collaborate with micro-entrepreneurs service providers in the region that can add value to their users with our products.

Ruleset - No-Code Decision Engine for Lenders,"Hey all, we’re Logan and Zheng building [Ruleset](https://ruleset.ai)! ## **❌ The Problem and Why It Matters** Financial firms have a decision process that determines who qualifies for a loan or not. Even firms using machine learning only have the ML model as one step. The problem is that these rules are defined by Risk and Legal teams. However, they are implemented by engineers who don’t fully understand them, and getting them wrong costs companies millions. ## **⚙️ How It Works** We provide a drag-and-drop interface which makes it easy to create a decision workflow from a basic building blocks. These “rule” components can read/write from data sources, do calculations, and fork data paths for different outcomes. For our customer’s tech teams, integrating a Ruleset into their systems (to display the results on their website) should be as easy as plugging in Stripe. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/129850/0f7339ff-c5d5-45d7-a16c-050c4bc9af9f) ## ❓**Why Are We Working on This?** The idea clicked when I was recently at Regional Finance (NYSE: RM) launching new online lending products. I experienced this problem alongside our Risk and Legal teams, where an evaluation of existing vendors didn’t find one which could quickly and easily solve our issues. Zheng and I previously worked together for two years at a Series A startup and knew we could build the right solution. ## **🙏 The Ask** If you or someone you know works in Risk, Legal, or Operations at a financial firm, or if you’ve tried other decision workflow tools and they didn’t solve your problem, shoot me an email at [logan@ruleset.ai](mailto:logan@ruleset.ai) and I’d love to discuss how we can help!",Logan Frederick,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/2946061d798cc7c4a3e4097d64a74e9585388f80.jpg,Otherimage_26715_1.jpg;,26715

Wolfia - Turn your app into a link,"Hi! We’re Fabien and Naren, founders of [Wolfia](https://www.wolfia.com) and former mobile developers at Facebook and Wealthfront. **Wolfia is a mobile app emulator you can access through the browser.** ## The pain Teams working on a mobile app currently have to wait for it to be built and pushed to them at night. That's if they even have a nightly build setup. Most people also only have one phone, so they can never test the Android app if they have an iPhone and vice versa. ## The cure Wolfia lets developers send a link to an APK (an Android binary) that's running on an emulator accessible via the browser. You can play with the app without the need for a physical device (iOS coming soon!). * Product Managers and Designers can use it to check that a new feature is being built up to their specs. * Developers can use it to check if the code is running correctly. * Founders, User Researchers and Salespeople can use it for interactive demos of the product. **We're live: try it for free at** [**wolfia.com**](http://wolfia.com)**!** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/13513/4a3a30e4-8f94-40b9-bf44-7785561b9ab1) ## The tech We host headless (without GUI) android emulators with [hardware acceleration](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator-acceleration) running on [AWS bare metal instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-bare-metal-instances-with-direct-access-to-hardware/) to get high performance. We use WebSockets to make a two-way connection between the browser and the emulator through [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb). The emulator's GUI is displayed on the browser via an H.264 video feed, and we relay the user's touch events back to the emulator. We use [WSS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455#section-3) to make this secure. ## The story We've been developing mobile apps for 10+ years, and in that time, the tooling has dramatically improved. Yet we found ourselves having to go and install emulators on a PM's laptop and give them commands to copy and paste on the terminal because they didn't have an android phone. Or we would have to procure test phones and wait for a build to be pushed.

ALT TEX: Fabric made from food waste 🍎👕,"Hey All! We’re [Myra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myra4/) and [Avneet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/avneet-ghotra-51284728/), co-founders of [ALT TEX](http://thealttex.com). We’ve created the world’s first polyester-alternative fabric, made from food waste. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65136&key=user_uploads/578199/71da3b57-6b33-4db2-a80f-becf0dd70065) 🌍 **The problem: polyester is leading fashion’s GHG emissions, but has no circular alternative.** The fashion industry’s heavy reliance on petroleum-derived polyester textiles is a major contributor to the 10% of global GHG emissions the industry generates annually. The plastic-based material, found in 60% of the clothes we wear, creates over 50 million tons of global annual landfill waste, generates 35% of all ocean micro-plastics, and consumes 70 million barrels of oil each year. Despite 1/3 of the fashion industry committing to 0 carbon emissions by 2050, polyester, the most widely used fabric, has no fully circular, carbon-neutral alternative. At the same time, food waste is on the rise with 1 billion tons generated annually across the world. So, we’re using one problem 🍎 to fix the other 👕. Here’s how ⬇️ 👕 **The Solution: Fabric created from the world’s largest waste source - food waste.** ALT TEX reduces the fashion industry’s dependence on fossil fuels through its biodegradable and carbon-neutral textiles engineered from food waste. The patent-pending fermentation technology plugs into the existing polyester supply chain to provide fashion brands with a cradle-to-cradle polyester alternative without sacrificing performance. The product solves key problems for fashion brands, consumers, and the environment: 1. Fashion brands: ALT TEX sells fabric to fashion brands, allowing them to differentiate via sustainable options (sustainable fashion growing 11% CAGR) and hit sustainability targets, without sacrificing performance or changing their current supply chain. 2. Consumer: The ALT TEX fabric is projected to be half the price vs. other specialized sustainable alternatives (due to low-cost input and scalability), meaning greater accessibility. 3. Environment: A single shirt produced with ALT TEX fabric can divert 1 kg of food waste from landfills, 9 kg of carbon emissions from the air, and 4 g of micro-plastics from our waterways. **The Story & Future:** Myra and Avneet have worked on every school project together since the 9th grade. With Myra’s background in corporate sales and family history in the textile sector, alongside Avneet’s background in environmental science and biochemistry, the two came together in 2020 to build ALT TEX. Today, ALT TEX has created its fabric prototype, raised $2,300,000 USD in funding, secured $1,000,000 in pilot LOIs and has grown the team to 10. **How you can help:** As we scale out of the lab and into the market over the next year, we’re looking for: 1. fashion brands interested in sourcing a sustainable polyester alternative 2. food manufacturers looking for a sustainable way to re-purpose their waste If you’re curious or have help/resources for us, please feel free to reach out! 📩 [myra@thealttex.com](mailto:myra@thealttex.com) 🌐 [thealttex.com](http://thealttex.com) | [linkedin.com/company/alt-tex/](http://linkedin.com/company/alt-tex/) 👩‍💻 [@thealttex](https://twitter.com/thealttex)",Myra Arshad,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/a7545ee525a8ce037e02092f3887cf6713e3ead5.jpg,Otherimage_26769_1.jpg;,26769

We do this by automatically analyzing a codebase’s structure, similar to a compiler 🧑‍💻 so developers can increase their teammate’s autonomy with an integration-free platform. 🪄 **Watch the magic happen** [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sne6PcD1eL0&t=33s): ### 〰️ **Hey YC Community 👋** we’re Jake, Etai, and Tzachi and we’re building [FlyCode](https://www.flycode.com/). We’re on a mission to **help developers increase their teammate’s autonomy** by embedding iteration within product delivery workflows. ### **The Problem ❌** 1. **The constant back and forth** between design, product, and engineering; iteration cycles are devouring precious resources 2. **No one likes writing tickets** with a description, a screenshot, or a spreadsheet… then estimating effort and prioritizing only to see it in the next Q’s roadmap 😩  3. **Cross-functional teams are dependent on engineering** for most product changes or requests 4. **CMS & TMS integrations can take months to spin up** and are often deprioritized because of this, despite the real need ### **Our Solution 💡** FlyCode allows non-developers to contribute to web apps without actually coding. We enable Product and UX teams to edit their products in minutes by connecting directly to our GitHub application. * Editing product copy in resource files and ⚡**hardcoded**⚡ * Replace and upload new images and icons to your product * We support **React, Angular, Vue, Ruby on Rails, and PHP** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/651566/320fd067-120f-4687-966f-51f86e12c99b) ### **Integrate in minutes, not months ⏰** Connect our GitHub application to selected repositories for real-time results. Then invite your team to manage and edit product copy with auto-generated PRs. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/651566/00ca1af3-3921-4cff-877b-3eb44b00c1f4) ## **We’d love your support 🍻** [**Try FlyCode in minutes**](https://app.flycode.com/) **- seriously it only takes 5 min to completely set up!** **What else can we remove from engineering’s backlog?…** CSS, JSON configuration, analytics, A/B tests, etc. * Email us at [jake@flycode.com](mailto:jake@flycode.com), [tzachi@flycode.com](mailto:tzachi@flycode.com), or [etai@flycode.com](mailto:etai@flycode.com)",Jake Vacovec,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/b708841106d1c7adb6bedad02a3a7eab37769ecb.jpg,Otherimage_26901_1.jpg;Otherimage_26901_2.jpg;,26901
Craze - Trade real-world events like stocks,"**TL;DR:** **We built Craze, a mobile app that lets you trade real-world events just like you trade stocks. We’d love for you to** [**download it**](https://thecrazeapp.com?utm_source=launchyc&utm_medium=yc&utm_campaign=launchyc)**, check it out, and give us feedback by** [**emailing us**](https://mailto:team@thecrazeapp.com)**.** Hey, what’s good? We’re [Tarun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tarunmuraliprasad/), [Kabir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kabirnagral/), and [Deepit](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepitpatil/), the founders of [Craze](https://thecrazeapp.com?utm_source=launchyc&utm_medium=yc&utm_campaign=launchyc). Kabir and I were studying CS at Harvard and Deepit was studying at IIT Delhi, but we decided to take a break from college to build Craze instead. ### **What is Craze?** Craze is an exchange where you can trade and discuss the outcomes of real-world events. So if you’re a Drake fan, instead of just talking about your opinions, you can now put your money where your mouth is and invest in a Craze market predicting that Drake will be the highest-selling artist this year. We have markets in topics ranging from tech and economics to entertainment and social media. We currently only serve the Indian market. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65128&key=user_uploads/983575/51c978a4-897f-4f0c-a3c6-81f7c133fe42) ### **How does it work?** Each market on Craze is based on a real-world event that has multiple outcomes. Craze allows you to buy or sell shares of any of these outcomes. Just as in the financial markets, the price of one share of an outcome is determined by market supply and demand. These prices vary between ₹0 and ₹100. After buying shares of an outcome, you may choose to exit your position to book profits or minimize losses. After the market closes and the true outcome of the real-world event is known, the market settles; this means that each share of the correct outcome pays out ₹100. You can also make posts showcasing your portfolio and exits and discuss the outcomes of events. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65128&key=user_uploads/983575/21593802-4c88-492f-b907-756c6d6b62c5) ### **Why should this exist?** Craze empowers Indians to make better decisions in their lives based on the actionable insights they receive from the trading activity within our markets. The markets on Craze are very likely to be more accurate than traditional forecasters and polls because they aggregate the wisdom of the crowds by giving people a financial incentive to share their true beliefs. We give people insight into real-world events like inflation and unemployment that are materially relevant in their lives. These markets also serve as a factual and true counter to sensationalized content, fake news, and the spread of misinformation on social media and in society at large. ### **How you can help 🤗** If you’re based in India, **download our mobile app** [**here**](https://thecrazeapp.com?utm_source=launchyc&utm_medium=yc&utm_campaign=launchyc) and let us know what you think!

👩‍⚕️ Almond – ELEVATED CARE FOR DOWN THERE 🚺⬇️,"We’re [Tara](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/196433) and [Carly](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/user/922870), and we’re excited to introduce [Almond:](https://almondobgyn.com/) we’re building a better healthcare experience for women 🌸 ✨ TL;DR Almond is like One Medical but for women’s health: we make it easy to get great ObGyn care, both at our in-person office and over telehealth. **We’re growing quickly.** Even before we opened our first location we hit $90k run rate revenue, and we’re booking out 3 weeks in advance. **You can book an appointment with us in LA.** Our first full service clinic just opened in Los Angeles (see a couple of photos below)!! Book an appointment at [www.almondobgyn.com](http://www.almondobgyn.com) or call 424-237-8406. Share with your friends and family to help the women in your life have a better option for ObGyn care.  **Membership is affordable and we take all major insurance.** * Membership is $250 annually but our founding members can get their first year of membership for $150.  * For visits, you can either use insurance or pay out of pocket. We accept Cigna, Aetna, Blue Shield, Anthem Blue Cross, and United HealthCare. ### ObGyn today is broken As women, we’ve had too many frustrating experiences with our ObGyn care. We may love our doctors but the process _around_ seeing the doctor can be terrible: long hold times to schedule, waiting a month or longer for an appointment, and often leaving an appointment with unclear next steps. Our modern world gives us so many great service experiences, yet when it comes to the most important aspect of our lives – our health – we are forced to put up with a slow, confusing process.  Billions of dollars have been poured into modernizing primary care, yet women are still waiting for a better option for ObGyn care. The overturning of Roe is a harsh reminder that women still aren’t given the resources or the rights to be full decision makers over their own bodies. We are building Almond because women deserve better.  ### Why better ObGyn care matters The impact of better ObGyn care is massive. There are 130M women in the US and they all need ObGyn care every year. On top of that, ObGyn is where women typically have their first intense, high stakes experiences with healthcare. We spend $200B a year on ObGyn care in the US; it is the second largest specialty by spend, after only primary care. Yet currently, women don’t have a brand they can trust and where they know they’ll have a great experience. At Almond we believe women should have an extraordinary care experience: one that offers quality, transparent care, delivered faster.  ### We’re freeing up the ObGyn’s time so they can focus on what matters most One of the first problems to tackle in ObGyn care is that doctor time is used inefficiently, wasting already limited ObGyn capacity. This makes access to care slow, and patients often feel their questions are unaddressed or they get unfit care. We’re able to make care more convenient because we use doctor time better – we build software tools to take unnecessary tasks off their plates and we hire a wider range of care providers, not just doctors. By freeing up time for ObGyns they can spend more time on what matters most – delivering great care in every interaction, and seeing the patients that need their attention sooner. We also believe getting [ObGyn](https://almondobgyn.com/) care should feel like a true-self care experience for patients, so our offices and software are designed to be convenient, reliable, and intuitive. ### We would love your help 1. We are hiring engineers. We’re particularly interested in meeting people who are passionate about what we are working on – e.g., they are women that have felt this pain themselves or are energized by the idea of building a better health system in the US. Here are our JDs for [backend](https://www.notion.so/Almond-Back-End-Engineer-423ff23660864e29be34fbd828ff0b6f) and [frontend](https://www.notion.so/Almond-Front-End-Engineer-7280fd76c3664dd1bb52864cc43f0126) eng roles.

Book an appointment at [www.almondobgyn.com](http://www.almondobgyn.com) or call 424-237-8406. And share with your LA-based friends and family!  3.

Pluralith - Automated Terraform Infrastructure Visualization & Documentation,"Hi we are Dan and Phi… ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/00d3f03c-7be2-4245-be6a-b1ac5931d882) … and we are building Pluralith! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/f7d9a731-4769-423f-9dfd-7bdf920137e6) ### **TL;DR** Title says it all. Pluralith lets you generate instant infrastructure diagrams from your Terraform codebase, locally (for development) and in CI (for documentation). [**Try it out here!**](https://docs.pluralith.com) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/9884a243-92d0-46ea-92f7-7dcd0cedb91c) ### **Watching > Reading** So here’s a [freshly baked demo](https://youtu.be/Jbbil9kA-EE) just for you! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/42257960-a912-40f1-acb6-f089d4da1153) ### **The Problem(s)** **Problem 1**: Infrastructure documentation is super important and often even required for proper compliance, but can be really time intensive and nobody wants to do it. So you’ve got two options: → Stay compliant and have good docs **BUT** loads of dev hours spent on them → No/few dev hours spent on docs **BUT** break compliance and no docs when you need them **Problem 2**: Terraform is awesome, but can become quite messy and intransparent at scale. Understanding what is actually going on requires digging through loads of code and terminal output. Again, lots of dev hours lost here. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/1fc7af56-e700-4227-bcb9-0fc872b49446) ### **The Solution: Enter Pluralith** **_Pluralith completely automates problem 1 away._** Run it in CI, automate parts of your compliance process and always have up-to-date infra diagrams whenever you need them. We throw them into PR comments and have a dedicated markdown integration so you can plug it straight into your existing docs (ReadMes, Confluence etc.). We do change highlighting, drift detection, cost calculations and compliance checks (coming soon) and keep a history of all this stuff in your Dashboard for you so you have a perfect record on how your infra changes over time. **_Pluralith alleviates problem 2._** Replace miles of terminal output on a terraform plan with a comprehensive diagram that shows you what your infrastructure looks like, how it’ll change on apply, how much it’ll cost and wether it breaks compliance (coming soon). All you have to do is run `pluralith plan` instead. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/079e25e0-225e-443b-b052-3eaab564aa50) ### **How It Works** **Locally**: Download our desktop app and follow it’s setup guide. In a minute you should be able to run `pluralith plan` in any of your Terraform project directories and get a diagram instantly. **In CI**: The illustration below says it all. Set up Terraform in your pipeline, run Pluralith and there you go. Right now we have dedicated integrations for _GitHub Actions_ and _Gitlab CI._ (Many more to come) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/42ca4f68-1bff-48c5-a0c0-e9b1c3786746) ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65103&key=user_uploads/690046/0f6a5cbc-52d6-4a6c-bfdf-bb4672190d94) ### **Help Us Out?** → [**Give it a run**](https://docs.pluralith.com) (either in CI or locally) and let us know all the ways our stuff broke through the emails below! → Our open source CLI is looking for some stars. [**Give it a star!**](https://github.com/Pluralith/pluralith-cli) → If you are a DevOps professional → [**Pick any slot on here!**](https://calendly.com/dantheputzer/meet) We’d be stoked to chat about the infra landscape!

Tank Payments: The neobank built for trucking businesses,"We’re Dane, Jad, and Matt, and we’re excited to introduce Tank Payments. ### **❌ The Problem** When truckers haul loads, shippers stipulate 30 to 90 day payment terms, which is too long for many trucking companies that operate on thin margins. To access cash faster (1-3 days), trucking companies sell their invoices to financing companies called “factors” for a 2-5% fee. Many truckers end up paying up to $40 in fees per invoice to wire money from their factors if they need cash from their factors immediately, meaning that **some truckers give up close to 10% of their income to get access to the money they’ve already earned.** Money movement in freight is not efficient, causing truckers to stitch together a variety of tools (Cash App, local commercial banks, factoring, fuel cards, and more) to manage their businesses. Even the business that pay truckers (e.g. factors) use dated payments infrastructure, exacerbating delays. This leaves an opportunity for software that addresses these financial needs in a way that’s purpose-built for the freight industry. ## **✨ Our Solution** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/793427/be064c4e-46a5-4172-8c84-dd10830f6b9a) **Tank Payments is a banking experience specifically designed for the freight industry, and its first feature allows truckers to get paid faster.** We give truckers instant access to their money by putting factors and truckers on the same financial infrastructure. Factoring companies partner with Tank because our infrastructure reduces their time spent on accounts payable, and helps them retain customers by offering a better funding experience. Over time, the Tank Payments will become the finance department for trucking SMBs, supporting the many unique financial requirements of freight businesses. We’ve pinpointed payroll, expense management, insurance, and P2P payments as areas of priority that our neobank is well-positioned to serve. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/793427/e85b3331-683f-4031-bd75-51747ce4bb4c) Our team worked together for the past 7 years, first at a startup (Graphiq, acq. 2017) and then at Amazon Alexa AI. We bring experience in financial services, data analytics, digital security, and natural language processing to a freight industry in the midst of a tech adoption boom. ### **🙏 Asks** 1. We would love to connect with founders and teams that have **experience embedding 1) payroll, 2) card rewards (e.g. fuel discounts), and 3) insurance into their software**. 2. Tank wants to expand and distribute its neobank through entities that pay truckers, beyond factors. We want to learn more about how players like international freighters (e.g. Maersk), freight forwarding companies (e.g. Flexport), domestic shippers (e.g. Kroger’s Markets), and third-party logistics providers (e.g. C.H. Robinson) **perform payouts and if they could benefit from payment speed and/or coordination.**",Matthew Rybak,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/1eed17c86d493beb4042fed9177133676521db76.jpg,Otherimage_26803_1.jpg;Otherimage_26803_2.jpg;,26803

Levo Financial - Spendable Investment Account,"Hey everyone! We’re Zach McCormick, Nick McCormick, Dillon Martin, and Justin Clark from [Levo Financial](https://www.levofinancial.com/).  ### **TLDR** Levo is a Spendable Investment Account. It works just like a checking account (you get a debit card and a bank account and routing number), but your money stays invested in stock and bond ETFs instead of just sitting there in cash. After spending a year in beta, we’ve finally launched and are looking to get as many people as possible to try it out and give us feedback. ### **Who we are** We’re a team of four that previously built a quant hedge fund together. We’ve always loved working at the intersection of finance and technology, so starting Levo felt like the natural next step for us. We’re currently living and working in the beautiful mountains of Utah. ### **The problem** Before Levo, you had to make a choice: how much cash do you need to keep on hand and how much can you set aside in a long-term investment account? This is a tough choice, because future spending needs are uncertain. Most people err on the side of caution and leave a large chunk of cash in their checking account, where it earns a very meager amount of interest at best.  ### **Our solution** With Levo, you don’t have to make that choice. You can spend directly from your invested balance with your Levo debit card and pay bills with your account and routing number, but your money stays fully invested right up until the point you spend it. You get the best of both worlds: the convenience of a checking account, and the returns of an investment account. Set up your direct deposit with Levo and it could be the only account you need. Here are the headline features we have live right now  * Debit card * Bank account and routing number. You can use this to pay bills, link Venmo, set up direct deposit, etc.  * Five investment portfolios of varying risk levels to choose from, ranging from a super safe 100% bond portfolio to a higher risk 100% stocks portfolio. All portfolios use a broad selection of ETFs to maximize diversification. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65076&key=user_uploads/235988/fdcb4c9b-e29e-43e9-a991-b26f749a874a) ### **Our ask** We’re live in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/levo-financial/id1619186716) and the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.levoapp), so we’d love it if you would download the app and create an account. You can use **ycfam** when it asks for an invite code. (Note that Levo is only available for US citizens for now.) And most importantly, give us as much feedback as you can.

It represents a way for people to pool and mitigate significant risks when events have shaken out for the worst.  But the way insurance is been bought and sold has generated a mismatch between the protection from risk that insurance products SHOULD provide. This forces tens of thousands of people to go bankrupt every year from risks that could be properly insured– Often while overpaying for insurance that doesn't protect them from catastrophic risks. ### Problem: Insurance is complicated The web of carriers, brokers, contracts, and claims that ensure your risks are properly handled can be an absolute nightmare for people who just want to feel like the things that are important to them are protected. ### The Solution: A one-step process to find the best insurance We collect information on how much you feel comfortable losing, in addition to more standard insurance questions.

Coris - Manage Small Business Risk Thoughtfully,"**Coris is a Risk API for Fintechs that underwrite SMBs** Hi everyone ! This is [Shyam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shyammaddali/) and [Vinodh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinodhpo/) from [Coris](https://www.coris.ai/). We are super stoked to share with y’all what we are building. ### **Background** Shyam and I have spent last 20+ years at companies such as eBay, PayPal, WePay/JPMC (_YC S09_) and Google managing small business risk for payments and lending products. Two of the biggest problems we faced were in gaining a solid understanding of what a SMB does at the time of underwriting and continuing to keep a tab externally on how they operate. ### **Problem** **Traditional bureaus hardly help** with small business credit risk assessment given their abysmal coverage of small businesses, lack of predictive data, painful integrations, and expensive products. Fintechs especially struggle to get the right data on quality of a small business to accurately assess credit exposure While payments data and bank-level financial data have helped somewhat in recent times to fill the void in SMB underwriting, they still miss some huge signals on how a business operates. Biggest problem is lot of **valuable data on a business remain unstructured** in the open internet for models/rules to consume Also once a small business is approved for payments, lending or another credit product, **most companies are in dark about them** until they see chargebacks come in or see missed payments ### **Solution** We believe there is tremendous potential for alternative credit-relevant data in SMB risk management. With that said, we have two products to start with: 1. **Alternative data on every SMB** in the US through one developer-first API - Licensing details, Website Professionalism signals, Online Reviews based signals, Business Incorporation details, and Local Inspection data 2. **Monitoring of small businesses** across various online/offline surfaces and raise an alert for action when a business deterioration/failure is suspected, much before chargebacks or defaults start happening ### **Our Asks** 1. If you are running a Fintech/Platform and serve SMBs in the US, we would love to get your direct feedback on what we are building. Even better, **sign up to our** [**beta here**](https://www.coris.ai/#contact_form) ! 2. **Connect us to platforms/companies** that might benefit from what we are building or for us to learn from 3. **Feel free to say hi at** [founders@coris.ai](mailto:founders@coris.ai) ! We love riffing on SMB underwriting/fraud/KYB and talk shop on where the industry is heading 4. Last but not the least, **please share this post** !

Artemis: Retool for desktop applications,"Hello, we’re [Austin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austin-mccoy-833600229/), [Manvir](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manvir-singh-abb298247/) and [Kyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-h-202515237/) — we founded [Artemis](https://artemisdevtool.com/). **_tl;dr_** _It takes too long to give desktop internal tools usable GUIs. Artemis fixes that._ ### **Problem:** Artemis was born in a Caltech robotics lab when our founder Austin realized too much time was spent giving internal tools usable GUIs. Building front-ends for internal tools written in programming languages like Python, C, C++ and Matlab is a tedious process that makes it slow and difficult to deploy even the simplest projects. Existing solutions aimed at solving this problem like Java’s Netbeans or Python’s QT only aid the user in designing how their interface will look, leaving the task of coding each element’s functionality. The complexity of these tools also present a high barrier to entry – especially for users who are just trying to make simple interfaces. These users don’t need all the bells and whistles of QT, they just need a simple solution they can learn and employ quickly. ### **Artemis Solution:** Artemis’ drag and drop interface lets developers rapidly design front-ends comprised of elements that function out-of-box. This prepackaged functionality means integration is a breeze. Here’s how it works: 1) Create your interface in our drag-and-drop webtool: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1018852/93a29830-bbc4-4a98-a054-995f401064a4) 2) Integrate into codebase with three steps (minimal overhead) ![uploaded image](https://bookface.ycombinator.com/media/?key=user_uploads/982880/bf607bd0-7015-4777-b264-72c6128ada94) 3) Launch your new interface (runs in browser to facilitate cross platform use, but still works offline) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1018852/c497ce1e-e1f0-4d6b-ab4d-f25340a53401) ### **Project history, use cases, and pricing:** **History:** We began life as an augmented reality development platform that functioned in almost the same manner. However after realizing how small that market is, we’ve pivoted to a broader one. That being said: we remain so cross platform you can even build frontends to be displayed in AR and VR. **Use Cases:** Artemis is a must-have for anybody who builds internal tools. Some examples include: Machine learning dashboards • GUIs for engineering tools • Control panels for machinery & IoT devices • GUIs for physicists’ models and calculators • And whatever else you can build! **Pricing:** $9 a month after 1 week free trial",Kyle Hooten,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/d89b41ff5cd93ade4dff049777a0981f96e3217b.jpg,Otherimage_27042_1.jpg;Otherimage_27042_2.jpg;Otherimage_27042_3.jpg;,27042
Feather: Modern 401(k) for startups,"_TLDR; Feather helps startups offer 401(k) to founders and early team, while saving them time and money. We make getting 401(k) for your company as easy as signing up for a credit card - in under 20 minutes!

We’re [Aahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aahansawhney/) and [Saurabh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saurabhj80/), co-founders of [Feather](https://feather.credit). Having worked in big tech companies like Apple, Google, Oracle, Square, we were always offered many financial benefits, including 401(k). However, once we left our jobs and started working for our startup, we saw the gap: **having 401(k) as an early startup is complicated. It requires compliance overhead, doesn’t scale in pricing, and takes time to onboard. This is the reason why 90% of startups don’t offer 401(k) to founders and early employees. So we decided to change it!** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1013865/af0f192e-dd57-4127-a9fa-31fa17bf409c) ### 💸 **Why does a startup need 401(k)?** For founder-only startups, 401k is a great way to pay less income taxes and build a safety net. For growing startups, 401k helps hire and retain top talent. You build a great company culture allowing your employees to save for their retirement. Regardless of the company stage, the cost of having 401(k) can be offset with tax credits (worth up to $16,500 total) 💵 ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1013865/e338539b-cc2c-40dd-8be4-1beb3f59237c) ### ✅ **Feather makes getting 401(k) easy!

Moonshot - Angel Investing in athletes 🏈🎾⚽️🏀🚀,"**tl;dr** 🏈🎾⚽️🏀 With Moonshot you can angel invest in athletes. We enable promising athletes to fund their professional journey with the help of a community of backers, in exchange for a portion of their earnings when they make it. Hey everyone! We’re [Youssef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/youssef-rizk-397b19107/) and [Dimitris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitris-nikolaou-29753080/), co-founders of Moonshot. We met working at Palantir as software engineers and recently left to build on a mission that is near and dear to our hearts. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=65039&key=user_uploads/1010390/8bc31829-f3dc-4348-8582-2f85da5d3501) **What’s the problem?** **Becoming a professional athlete is expensive and risky.** Professional tennis players spend more than $100,000 annually to finance tournament fees, travel, accommodation, coaching, etc, which is prohibitive for most mere mortals. As a result, only those privileged enough to sustain this deficit can really make it in the sport. This is a real problem for those with underprivileged backgrounds, but don’t just take our word for it, take Hollywood’s. [The Blind Side](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0878804/) (true story) and [Hustle](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8009428/) capture this essence in their storylines. **How do we solve this? We bring supporters to the rescue** Back your favourite up-and-coming athlete by investing in their career! When they make it big, you’ll have secured the ultimate bragging rights, and you’ll make a nice return on your investment in the form of a cut (think \\~5-10%) on their future earnings. Athletes get the money they need to continue their professional career. Backers get to meaningfully support their favourites and a significant financial stake in their success. Win win. **Some concrete use cases we’ve come across** 1. Individual sports (Tennis, Golf and Motorsports) - capital may act as a catalyst, by providing the opportunity to fund competition participation and better coaching. 2. Team sports (Basketball and Football) - capital may act as an insurance policy. A college athlete can capitalise on the potential of a future large contracts in the NBA or NFL. 3. In most sports, there are one-off career changing events - think of preparation for the NFL Draft Combine, or making a run for the Olympics. Capital may act as a bridge in order for the athlete to reach peak level at the time of the event. **Want to contribute** 1. Sign up to our backers [waitlist](https://moonshot.li/).

Chordio - Lightweight sprint planner for remote development teams,"👋 Hi everyone! Ehud and Amit, co-founders of [Chordio](https://chordio.com) here. We previously co-founded [Brand.ai](https://Brand.ai) to help designers and developers work better together. We sold the company to InVision in 2017 and worked on improving product team collaboration since. With Chordio, we’re looking to help teams at any size plan their work better. ### **Why we’re building Chordio** Existing tools focus on issue tracking, and underserve the upfront project planning needs. Prioritization, estimation, and capacity planning are commonly problems teams are left to struggle with. The transition to remote work made planning harder still, as planning had often started with a whiteboard huddle. The average project management tool doesn’t speak casual. It’s built for an official plan, due dates, and commitments. That’s why over 80% of the teams we’ve talked with reach for a general-purpose solution like a spreadsheet for their planning activities. They then face a different set of problems: sweating over manual work, getting formulas wrong, dealing with random editors breaking fragile automations, accumulating massive backlogs, and losing sight of the source of truth among a sea of documents. So, we’re building Chordio as the best of both worlds. A lightweight, collaborative tool with key planning features built-in. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1010497/73819665-290c-41d1-9d44-5cfe67e9ba8b) ### **How it works** Chordio lets you work at the right planning fidelity. Go from a casual brainstorm to evaluating rough plan outlines, to an official release plan. When you’re done, export the work to Jira or your issue tracking tool of choice. - Integrations are coming soon. You can create any number of planning boards where you can specify a focus for the sprint, list features, provide estimates, and assign to people. As you assign tasks you’ll see the capacity graph of individuals getting updated so you can protect people’s time and ensure an optimal sprint scope. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1010497/68d67d7e-1ce9-4713-a9c9-9e4eaf8d69ed) ### **Partner with us?** We’re looking for design partners. That is, companies that will pilot Chordio’s next major release and provide early feedback to guide our roadmap. **If you’re running multiple projects and interested in improving upfront planning, and ongoing visibility into teams’ work at any level, let’s talk.** Here’s a [Calendly link](https://calendly.com/ehud-chordio/design-partnership) to book some time.",Ehud Halberstam,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/b8c0008c97acd1a307f0ae85cc3269ac49799896.jpg,Otherimage_26660_1.jpg;Otherimage_26660_2.jpg;,26660

They transform agricultural waste (corn husks, wheat straw, etc.) into protein-rich, meaty-tasting food. And they do it without arable land, irrigation, or energy intensive lighting. With 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions coming from food, this is an opportunity we must seize. Fungi are our chance to produce quality food at scale with near-zero environmental impact. **Problem: They’re labor intensive** \\ Unfortunately, producing mushrooms and fungi is labor intensive, limiting their scale and affordability. For even the most sophisticated mushroom and fungi farms, labor is the vast majority of cost. They require delicate handling and careful monitoring – difficult jobs to automate. **Solution: Robots** \\ Oh yeah. Robots. We’re building robotics and AI to automate each step of production. Autonomous dexterous manipulation harvests, breaks down, and packages the mushrooms. Computer vision and low-cost sensors power decisions like when to harvest. AI optimizes >25 parameters to increase yield. Eliminating labor and increasing yield will reduce costs by 70%+.   \\*\\*How you can help:\\*\\*\\ We aim to unleash fungi as our next major food source, making these healthy, sustainable foods affordable for anyone.

Two Dots - Income & Employment Verification for Lenders,"### **The Problem** Traditionally when a consumer wants to borrow money, take out a mortgage, or rent an apartment, they need to provide the underwriter with a bunch of financial documents to prove they can afford the product.  This is a time consuming & fraud ridden process! ### **Our Solution** To solve this problem we’re first automating the process of verifying income and employment data for large property managers. Over time we plan to integrate with many data sources so payroll data can be seamlessly used to make better & faster underwriting decisions by any financial institution. ### **Who We Are** I started my career working at Goldman for 4 years, before making the jump to startup-land as the 4th employee at a proptech startup, where we processed online rental applications.  Seeing up close how broken the income verification process is, and how broken the overall way underwriters decide who gets access to housing (credit scores), lead us to realize there’s a better way. Max started his career as one of the first engineers on the income verification team at Blend, spending years working on this problem before making the jump to work on search at Google.  After experiencing both the excitement of being early at a rapidly scaling startup (Blend is now public), and the mega-scale of search at Google, Max and I decided we were the team to tackle the broken consumer underwriting system. ### **How You Can Help** Our biggest focus today is getting more customers, **so if you know anyone managing thousands of rental properties we would love an intro!** You can reach me at [henson@twodots.net](mailto:henson@twodots.net) or text me at 415-699-6416 to make it happen.",Henson Orser,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/8ad18bb808ecb7004e70e21894f7eb49867be519.jpg,,26704

Probably Nothing Labs - Databricks for Web3,"**🤔 The Problem** Indexing public blockchains is a major pain! Engineers need to build resilient poll loops around chain specific validators that request, parse, and track raw blocks, transactions and event logs as they arrive. This work requires in-depth knowledge of specific protocols, smart contract ABIs, and stateful stream processing (not to mention handling chain re-org or tracking the mempool). All of this work just to build a backend for your Uniswap position tracking dashboard or that Instagram for NFTs app. Nevermind having to build systems to monitor individual positions for collateral drops in DeFi lending protocols.  **🤌 Our Solution** We built **Gigabrain**, a best-in-class blockchain indexer with support for Ethereum and Solana. Using advanced stateful streaming techniques, Gigabrain is able to parse, index, and store transactions within seconds of blocks being confirmed. In addition, we’ve created a versioned registry of all smart contracts on Ethereum as well its L2s. With Gigabrain you can — * Run **complex stateful aggregations** for **on-chain events** as soon as - or before - they show up on the blockchain. * Never have to worry about keeping track of contract specific ABIs with our **Smart Contract Registry**. * **Run live SQL** against the **Ethereum mempool** (we use a globally distributed set of nodes that we manage ourselves). * Run **large scale analytics** against our datalake as well as **power robust data backends** for your own Web3 apps.

Keylika: Redefining the Standard of Care for Iron Deficiency,"[Keylika](https://www.keylika.com) is combining its **metallodrug synthesis technology** with **optimized delivery methods** to obtain improved clinical outcomes. Our first product is a **novel iron drug** in a **wearable skin patch** with significantly improved safety, efficacy and tolerability to treat **Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA).** When approved, Keylika’s proprietary transdermal iron will be the **world's first** prescription iron patch. ### **The Problem** **Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) is a hugely understated, highly prevalent problem with subpar treatments.** Iron deficiency (ID) affects **30 million** people in the US alone and about **1.6 billion** worldwide. Current treatments include oral iron supplements which are typically associated with low bioavailability and poor tolerability due to mild to severe gastrointestinal (GI) side-effects (constipation, nausea, stomach discomfort, diarrhea, etc.) often leading to patient non-compliance. Also, a significant number of patients just do not absorb iron taken orally.  The second line of treatment with intravenous (IV) iron infusions is more invasive, riskier, costlier and requires hospitalization due to the risk of anaphylactic shocks. ### **Our Solution** Our first product is a **new small molecule (new molecular entity)**, an **iron-containing drug** designed for **transdermal** delivery by a wearable skin patch: **NistuFe**. It is a safe, highly bioavailable iron complex with higher efficacy. A therapeutically relevant dosage is administered through the skin directly into the systemic circulation, thereby circumventing the gastrointestinal tract and all associated adverse effects. Thus, we combine the benefits of both orals and IV iron, and without their respective downsides: a drug suitable for self-administration with no GI side effects and no required hospitalization that yields a superior treatment outcome from the convenience of a patient’s home. This is slated to be a potentially **best-in-class, breakthrough therapy**. Our preliminary proof-of-concept in vivo studies in rats have demonstrated excellent results. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/756768/c93eab67-c28a-45c2-8a20-42843bbd0d16) ### **Our Science** At our core is a **platform synthesis technology** we have developed for synthesizing mixed ligand metal complexes. We are using this platform to generate a range of drug candidates for treating therapeutic conditions in the fields of hematology, pain and inflammation, metabolic disorders, infectious diseases and oncology. We then administer these drugs using proven delivery technologies, to effect the best clinical outcomes. Positioned at the **intersection of drug development and drug delivery**, we customize the molecular structure of the drug and its formulation to optimize the therapeutic delivery per clinical requirements. ### **Target Population** Our first indication being menorrhagia, our primary target population is **women of child-bearing age** in the US who suffer from severe to moderate ID, which has an estimated prevalence of 6 million. A wide range of other patient groups adds up to a potential **30 million** users in the US alone. ### **Our Ask** 1\\.     If you know anyone in your social circle suffering from Iron Deficiency, we would love to talk to them! 2\\.     If you are connected to biopharma companies with interests in the hematology space, could you please introduce us?

Disclo - Health disclosure and accommodation management platform,"_TLDR;_ [_Disclo_](https://www.disclo.com/) _helps employers maintain compliance by verifying, managing, and reporting on disability disclosure and accommodation requests in the workplace. We’re helping qualified employees secure the accommodations they need to succeed at work without having to disclose their underlying medical condition to their employer._ Hi everyone! We’re [Hannah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanrosols/) & [Kai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaikeane/), the co-founders of Disclo. In two years, we built one of the most-used disability recruiting platforms in the world, [Chronically Capable](https://www.wearecapable.org/). Through working with leading employers such as Meta, Levi Strauss, Lululemon, and more, **we landed on a major pain-point in today’s workplace: health disclosures are complicated, messy, and come with risk for both employees and companies.** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1038798/3c6fec5f-786e-4dea-840f-98d2f0850031) We are dedicated leaders in the disability community, and our co-founder Hannah experienced this pain-point herself when she entered the workforce after college and struggled to disclose her chronic illness. **We’re here to support over 60% of adults in the U.S. who live with some form of chronic health condition or disability.** ### ❌ Managing employee health disclosures is extremely messy, risky, and expensive for employers 1. It is illegal to store medical data inside of an HRIS (eg. Workday) 2. Disability lawsuits now make up ⅓ of EEOC cases…and they’re on the rise! 3. HR teamss are spending an enormous amount of time managing requests 4. HR managers are not equipped to handle requests. They also do not have medical knowledge to deem requests as “reasonable”. ### ✅ It’s Disclo time! Here’s how we’re tackling this massive problem in today’s workforce 1. Integrate with your HRIS and collect employee accommodation requests in a compliant and confidential manner. 2. [Disclo](https://www.disclo.com/) verifies the necessity and validity of requests directly with medical providers.  3. Administer workplace accommodations and manage requests in our HIPAA and SOC2 compliant portal. 4. Real-time data on costs, time spent, aggregated health data, cost of accommodations and more. + Track against EEOC and ADA requirements! ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1038798/f3f8b413-2a92-4851-874d-355287402a1c) ### ❓Do you know HR or Employee Relations professionals? We’re looking to connect with HR leaders looking to stay compliant while supporting the needs of their employees. If you know one, or are one, come Disclo with us!

Ruffo 🏝🏠 Cross-border real estate transactions,"**TL;DR -** When buying a home abroad, Ruffo lets buyers complete the required documents 100% online instead of having to get on a plane, go to a foreign consulate, or hire a foreign attorney. 🙄 **The problem** When purchasing real estate abroad, signing transaction documents is a huge pain. You either get on a plane to sign in person, take your chances going through a maddening DMV-like experience at the nearest consulate, or pay thousands of dollars to (often questionable) foreign attorneys for signing in your name. The risks, hassles, and costs of today’s cross-border document completion process drives many buyers to abandon their purchase halfway through, and forces many other would-be buyers to hold back. On top of stifling the homeownership dreams of buyers, today’s process also costs home sellers, real estate agents and mortgage lenders millions of dollars in lost sales every year. ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FpPiykbH8NQkTX3KxSy3oAlLOemXqafh-x66kcjUbyD_pEjzWMJlXEP52n0JR8RdR7bmcO9piJm_DJTlNu-qKSdV3UM1IImfwNaMq1gxl1gbA9tY4sS_hcgzrUztnA759US0RIXp9_2I1Rp4o7clYK0) 😌 **The Solution** We allow buyers to complete, sign and notarize foreign transaction documents from their computer or mobile phone in just minutes. Ruffo generates the relevant transaction documents and connects the buyer to a notary in the U.S. to sign and notarize online. Ruffo then obtains the required government certifications to ensure that the document is legally valid in the foreign country where it will be used. The end result is a seamless foreign document generation and signature experience that saves the buyer time and money, while helping home sellers, real estate agents and mortgage lenders close more sales in less time. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/8jFLBHCCeTIzLl_WorfdtCVagFyAHhQ1so48F_PnKiWNqP4WRGYqt3XfDytJJN3g24y0SrBsnHdoOHbA6lAurJT8zy6k8AtT7aV6V80DODrnooGLEvFFLSqONSZgBECBy1QIdspfRy-yWtYCs25XQQg) **In the words of one of our customers:** _“I’ve seen the difficulties other US buyers have gone through when trying to complete their documents \\[for the purchase of property abroad\\]. My experience has been completely different. Ruffo made the process quick and easy. I was able to complete it from my house, without having to go to a consulate or waste money.” -_ Rosa Parra, New York, NY. 🙏🥺 **The Ask** 1. **Introduce us to anyone you know who works (directly or indirectly) in real estate in Mexico, specially in areas frequented by tourists and expats like Cabo, Tulum, and etc.**. Real estate developers, agents, mortgage lenders, home marketplaces, mortgage marketplaces, appraisers, etc. Would love to chat with any of them! 2. If you or anyone you know is trying to purchase real estate in Mexico or the Dominican Republic, let us know! We’ll make it a lot simpler :) 3. If you know of anyone who has purchased real estate in a country they did not reside in, send them our way! We’ll pay them to tell us about their experience. 4. If you have ever had to deal with cross-border paperwork, we’d love to hear about it! Whether you loved or hated the experience, we’ll probably learn something from it and might learn of new ways our platform could create value.",Nelson Munoz,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/436eeadea04cb2271855628cd9e2ec403ff9d27a.jpg,,27045

Buzzle: Call Recordings → Voice of Customer insights,"### **TLDR:** [Buzzle](https://www.buzzle.ai/) listens to your call recordings so that you don’t have to (and because you don’t have the time to…). We help product marketing teams identify competitive moats and weaknesses, marketing teams generate & understanding voice of customer and product teams gauge demand in feature requests based on customer pain points, all automatically from a company’s library of recorded sales and success calls. ### **The Problem:** ⏰ ”I don’t have the time to listen to all of the call recordings sales generates, but I want to & I probably should” 🧐 “How do I learn where to go next? What are customers complaining about? Our sellers don’t know what to share with us and how it connects to our roadmap.” 📉 ”My buyers are spooked with the downturn, but I have no idea where to start looking to figure out what’s going wrong.” While call snippets and anecdotes from individual calls are perfect for deal review, building customer strategy requires you to take account of the entire voice of customer, which may potentially span thousands of individual conversations. Strategic teams — product, marketing, product marketing — care about the relationships among the discussions and ideas inside these individual calls. There is no way to generate this type of connecting insight without manually slogging through call recordings or interviews. ### **The Buzzle Solution** Customer conversations hold the lifeblood of companies, because they are a collection of **ideas** and **relationships** that matter to companies: between question and answer, objection and handler, and product functionality and pain point. Buzzle understands those relationships between and among conversations, and uses that knowledge to automatically detect and highlight the most important trends to product and marketing. Buzzle can help you hone in on anything from competitors to customer pain points, and help you understand when those topics are coming up in calls (and how they affect your deals) ![](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8bfae907-f705-49c4-8775-c060c9ae07b6/Untitled.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20220802%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220802T124123Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=a174460eb9b0d641b08f269fa9d82367209a3c5a0b788929a2f722c4efbfd4f7&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22Untitled.png%22&x-id=GetObject) Unsure of the latest trends?

Akiflow - Manage your time and tasks in one place,"Hello 👋 Nunzio and Sebastiano from [Akiflow](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/akiflow) here! ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/117279/d0fe1c55-7cda-4899-9ac4-bb4866fbee19) ### 🚩 **The problem: staying organized is hard.** Tasks are scattered around; they come from messaging apps (emails, slack, etc.), project management platforms, video calls, surfing the web, and constantly arise throughout the day. Furthermore, it's difficult to be realistic about how much work you can get done without a calendar that shows how much time you have in a day at work. ### **✨ The Solution:** **Akiflow consolidates tasks in a single inbox from different apps** (Gmail, Slack, Todoist, Notion, Asana, Trello, ClickUp, and anything else via Zapier). It makes it easy to capture tasks via our _command bar_ that can be opened anywhere on the device. The fully functional calendar supports tasks and it’s built for time blocking giving you a comprehensive view of your day/week. _Our command bar_ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/117279/b6cf5ab5-fa5f-43db-a928-2857d484a78a) _Timezone support and Share Availability_ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/117279/390022e0-c46c-44d0-af4d-2da1960e82d6) _Booking Slots_ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/117279/4ef0b091-a35c-4716-88c4-c37fd14b671f) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/117279/86540833-2140-4b96-93d5-3758e8125816) _Notifications and Agenda_ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/117279/b07d8bb3-8b8e-4e14-bd94-7be3abc910d4) **👉 Start your free trial! Click** [**here 👈**](https://akiflow.com/) ### **🎞️ Our story** When we started Akiflow, we build a way to quickly add information to different tools. It was a command bar, similar to Alfred, that allowed users to add events to the calendar or create tasks on Asana, Trello, etc. We soon realized that all we were doing was speeding up people's attempts to manage their own subpar productivity system. The ultimate goal of our users was to maintain constant organization by keeping everything in one place. Since they were unable to find an app that could assist them in doing so, they were trying to speed up the process of consolidating information manually. That’s why we decided to pivot and build a unified tasks + calendars app. We built integrations (via APIs) with multiple sources of to-dos (Gmail, Slack, Asana, etc..). We developed a full calendar experience, added shortcuts and a command bar (we kind of had this ready from Akiflow #1), and added a few features to accelerate routine tasks (join a call, share availability, ..) **👉 Start your free trial!

🚀 Peoplebox - OKR & performance platform for hypergrowth companies,"**TL;DR:** [**Peoplebox**](https://peoplebox.ai/) **solves the biggest problems of scaling companies - Misaligned teams and Poor Execution Speed. We do this by integrating with all your work tools, bringing every cross-aligned goal in one single dashboard to identify red flags on time.** Howdy, Everyone! We are [@Abhinav Chugh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhinavchugh/) and [@Alagu M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alagu2/), founders of Peoplebox, an OKR platform that makes it easy for growing companies to align their teams and execute faster. It serves as a source of truth for all your strategic goals and initiatives to align your teams and identify red flags early **without the friction of new software.** We are currently helping many companies, including **Razorpay (W15), Disney, Postman, Exotel, Khatabook (S18), StayQrious (W20)** achieve faster business results. ### **❌ The Problem** As companies grow, they find it difficult to execute their strategy with the same speed as before due to misalignment and lack of cross-functional visibility. OKRs solve this problem, but they are hard to implement. In fact, 7 out of 10 OKRs implementations fail, and no 1 reason is: **Set and Forget**. Today, * OKRs are written in spreadsheets * Metrics are tracked in BI tools * But MBRs (Monthly Business Reviews)/ QBRs are done in Powerpoints. ## **✨ What makes Peoplebox different?** Peoplebox integrates with all your work tools (SQL, Jira, Hubspot, Asana, Slack etc) to make real-time goal tracking and business reviews **magically easy**. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/4PtJRPu4p_gt7Jzwxsz_fZ_CxxnHy7ip2_uaUdDMzhgkEy2aU5YuPiz7RBsSTejZP01lVKw9fpPnEouw4KDiuv2AMcUz3u4q4qTMD0xUMcLHG8TFd50aoztjPcan8j1PxX1vxAGHGLibmjKGvxspvAw) It aligns and tracks all your strategic priorities, goals & initiatives in one place. This help identifies red flags early and makes timely corrections. In addition, your business reviews are structured and super effective, ensuring that 1. It happens on the same place where OKRs are set so you never miss talking about it. 2. Plug data, narratives, screenshots and media easily. 3. Can run structured reviews through templates, notes, and action items 4. Takes a few hours instead of days to prepare for reviews because of automated updates of goals and initiatives ![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9P-49NV7lpW0inlxEhtDD8KeEA1tlMrN8ogGT9VyS18s-E0pYouj0RVwi97N1SUuOxLsDWvhlBT_RWGVWfN6ZSJapDgdbtDesIVTuEt1wceLgO_UJvBtou3OgrhRiEB4pgm3_AKZKCrr-VatmYcEbaw) It is also deeply integrated with Slack to make it super easy for teams to update OKRs progress and tag people to start a conversation and fix the issues instead of waiting for review meetings. **In addition, Peoplebox also lets you** * Run your performance reviews cycle entirely only Slack * Do effective and actionable 1:1s to build high-performing teams * Run automated pulse and engagement surveys to be on top of your culture ### **Who are we, and why are we building this?** We are techies turned product guys, having built our first startups in Dublin, Ireland, and SF (YC S12) respectively. We joined [Practo](https://www.practo.com/), one of Asia’s largest health-tech startups, when it had 250 employees and saw it grow to 3,000 in just a couple of years. We witnessed the challenges of hypergrowth companies first-hand. We realized as companies grow, the problems of misalignment and lack of cross-functional visibility only becomes larger, resulting in poor execution speed, missed goals, high talent turnover, and sometimes death. Our vision at Peoplebox is to become the Operating System for strategy execution to help companies align and achieve moonshot goals. # **🎁 Let’s talk** If you are using OKRs or planning to use them, please [check us out](https://www.peoplebox.ai/) and book a demo to see how Peoplebox can help you implement it successfully and accelerate your business growth.

Allero - Prevent Non-compliant Code from Reaching Production,"### Hey Fam! 👋 I am [@Idan Shahar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/idan-shahar/?originalSubdomain=il) and together with [@Itai Peri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itayperry/) we founded [Allero](https://allero.io). ### 📣 TL;DR [Allero](https://allero.io) scans your code delivery processes (aka CI/CD pipelines) to verify that security, code quality, and compliance checks are in place and that only valid code reaches production. 🏁 ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64859&key=user_uploads/1014551/711f2234-57e1-44b6-8dd5-c9e678973107) ## 📖 Our Story Itai and I both have been engineers for most of our careers. During my years at Microsoft, I worked with lots of companies who developed microservices in the cloud. While microservices bring lots of advantages, they also come with a lot of complexity - as there are so many of them, often by the hundreds. Hundreds of microservices means hundreds of delivery processes - a significant bottleneck with DevOps engineers. I witnessed developers ending up developing their own delivery processes (CI/CD), while the DevOps team owns the process organization-wise and provides guidance to developers. This poses a huge challenge for companies (and in particular DevOps and Platform Engineers) to ensure CI/CD pipelines are up to security, quality and compliance standards. As a result, companies are forced to allocate significant engineering resources to deal with incidents like data breaches, complex rollbacks due to bugs, long delivery times, etc. ## 🤯 We solve it with one simple CLI tool! **Manage your deployment risks with us!** * ✔️ Simply query pipelines to ensure they are up to security, compliance, and quality standards, across the entire organization. * 📊 Gain visibility into your pipelines across multiple SCM and CI/CD platforms in one single tool. * 🏃 Simplicity is our thing. Just download the CLI, generate a token, and start querying pipelines. **For example:** * Verify that every pipeline implements Snyk / SonarQube / unit/integration tests. (or any other tool!) * Make sure binaries are not being published to the wrong destinations. * Get the top 10 pipelines that fail the most / are the slowest. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64859&key=user_uploads/1014551/eae5776e-8ef1-4b8d-8b5c-49f1cda57bca) **Sounds interesting?

"🐶🌷🐱 Wyndly - Fix your pollen, pet, or other allergies for life","Hello 👋, We're Aakash and Manan, and we're thrilled to showcase Wyndly! The way we treat allergies today, with Zyrtec and Claritin, is medieval medicine. It doesn't solve the underlying problem; it just tries to cover it up. Allergy immunotherapy is the future. Most people don't realize that allergies are now a **curable** disease. In the future, taking Claritin for allergies is going to seem like taking Tylenol for an ear infection. Why would you treat the symptoms when you could just cure the disease? Our home allergy therapy builds up your immune tolerance against your allergies. This fixes the root cause of your symptoms, lets you forget about the pills, and provides lifelong relief. This clinically-proven treatment is now available via telemedicine. * Do you have a pet allergy but want a puppy 🐕? * Do you buy Kleenex in bulk? * Are you sick of your child’s never-ending cold? * Are you tired of allergy shots? Let Wyndly change your life forever. Our doctors are able to see, test, and treat patients for their allergies across the nation. Start with our 5 minute [at-home allergy test](https://www.wyndly.com/products/at-home-allergy-test-kit), or use insurance [to see a doctor (in CO, CA, FL only, right now).](https://www.wyndly.com/pages/allergy-consult-with-insurance) ## Why allergies are a big deal 40 million allergy sufferers in the US treat their allergies like a chronic condition — they take multiple medications to manage their symptoms. Imagine medicine cabinets full of Zyrtec, Claritin, Singular, Flonase, and more — all taken regularly. Most sufferers don't realize they can free themselves from these medications and allergies. Manan Shah, is a board-certified ENT and allergist who has fixed thousands of patients of their allergies. During the COVID-19 crisis, we started Wyndly because Manan realized patients loved curing their allergies entirely from home. ## How Wyndly fixes allergies Wyndly uses home allergy immunotherapy to build up your immune system naturally so you can throw away the pills and live allergy-free. We made the immunotherapy process as convenient as possible for our patients. Here's what it looks like: * Our nationally-certified allergy test is taken at home. It only requires a single finger-prick — not dozens of needles like an in-office allergy test. * Using these test results, we mix you personalized allergy drops which are taken by mouth. We send them straight to your door. * You have unlimited access to our medical care team. Our free online visits can be done on video, phone, or secure chat. We're with you from your initial consult to the day that you're allergy-free. ### What are allergy drops? Allergy drops, also known as oral allergy immunotherapy, are a scientifically proven way to reduce allergic reactions which cause your sneezing, stuffiness, and constant runny nose. Similar to allergy shots, allergy drops work by introducing escalating doses of your personal allergy triggers to your body. This personalized treatment allows you to safely and naturally build up a tolerance. Over time, this reduces your allergy symptoms for the rest of your life. Your allergy symptoms will start to reduce within 6 weeks, and over the course of your therapy you'll develop life-long tolerance to your allergens.",Aakash Shah,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/2a922640b0ac8b967cfb08f218595e21d5120415.jpg,,22707

🎵 Intuned - The data assistant for engineering leaders,"**TL;DR:** [Intuned](https://www.intuned.io/) is the data assistant for engineering leaders. [Watch our demo](https://bit.ly/3PIvCY2) to see how it works, and [email us](mailto:founders@intuned.io) if you want to learn more or get early access! We are [Faisal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faisal-ilaiwi-77356135/) and [Zawad,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zawad-chowdhury/) and we are building [Intuned](https://www.intuned.io/)! We are on a mission to help engineering leaders! ### **❌ The Problem** Being an engineering manager day to day is not easy. There is a lot that engineering managers are dealing with, here are a few of the many issues we are trying to help with: * When it comes to people, many management decisions rely on gut feeling **alone.** This is why the performance-reviews period is a tough one. * There are a lot of repetitive, ad-hock, and manual tasks that are expected from a manager. An example is the regular reporting managers are often asked to prepare. Another one is the periodic planning activities that teams go through. * Driving change within organizations is hard, what makes it harder is the lack of an easy way to set measurable goals and track progress towards achieving them. * Managers have to deal with a set of different tools day to day, these tools all have different and inflexible notification systems, which makes them (as notification systems) useless. This is why managers use a pull model (go check on things) vs. a push model (they get notified) on the things they care about. ## **✨ Our Solution** While the problems above are common with most managers, the exact way they can be solved will depend on the manager, their team, their processes, and the systems they use. There is NO one-size-fits-all here! With [Intuned](https://www.intuned.io/)_,_ we are providing a toolbox to help! As an engineering leader, [Intuned](https://www.intuned.io/) will enable you to connect your data from the different systems you and your team use (Jira, Github, Notion, Excel, and more) and will give you a powerful way to query it, explore it, build metrics, and actions on top of it. Using this flexible approach, we believe we can help managers with many of their regular tasks, and save them time, effort and randomization. [Watch our 4-min demo to see how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzFTvSwFaqs) ### **⚙️ How does it work?** **🔗 Connect your data with a few clicks.** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64781&key=user_uploads/224423/95454f4b-64db-4a06-9e08-b3550b138824) **❓ Query and explore your data - save hours on building manual reports.** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64781&key=user_uploads/224423/107f6c59-9790-4eb4-a040-78e18dffdeda) **🔔 Setup a custom notifications - never miss a critical issue again!** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64781&key=user_uploads/224423/482e12d8-d5c3-4eb8-be56-e78960e44a0d) 🏗️ **Why build this?** As a former engineering manager myself, this is the product that I wish I had! 2\\.5 years ago, I became a manager for an engineering team of 2 that end up growing to around 20 people by the time I left _UiPath_. As my team was scaling, we experienced growing pains with engineers being blocked, deployments getting delayed, and overall team execution lagging. I realized our software delivery process wasn’t keeping up but I couldn’t pin point what it was. So I ended up building a small tool to help! That tool ended up being very useful. That tool is the inspiration behind [Intuned](https://www.intuned.io/). ### **Let’s Talk!** If you or someone you know are a leader of an engineering team who is feeling some of these pains, we think [Intuned](https://www.intuned.io/) can help! please [email us](mailto:founders@intuned.io) or [schedule a meeting](https://calendly.com/intuned/15min) with us.",Faisal Ilaiwi,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c9d0cd0dc50914ae87de900b1688042a650eb194.jpg,Otherimage_27255_1.jpg;Otherimage_27255_2.jpg;Otherimage_27255_3.jpg;,27255
🛫 Loop — flight simulator (for customer support 🧑‍💻),"Hey YC! tl;dr Using a work sample, we **automatically measure** whether someone’s likely to succeed in an entry-level support role. ### Why? In our last company, Paul & I manually read \\~25,000 job applications, specifically for entry-level ops and sales roles. (For example: customer support, real estate ISAs, “pre-sales” support, data, entry, taxi dispatchers, receptionists) We learned a lot, but eventually Paul said he felt “default dead inside” after reading 300 resumes in a row. So we decided to build tools to scale ourselves up. ### The problem 1. Reading resumes is _time-consuming_. Also, for entry-level jobs, resumes don’t tell you very much. 2. Wasting time interviewing candidates who clearly can’t do the job (i.e. the ops equivalent of fizz buzz) 3. Hiring candidates who **interview well**, but don’t do the **actual work** very well ### Our solution We built a 30-minute **interactive work sample** that you can give to all of your job applicants. If you’re like our early users, “ops hiring” is currently being run by a very high-leverage leader. That’s awesome — because you’ll have a high bar — but it’s also extremely expensive. **With Loop, you can raise that bar even higher, while saving 20+ hours of work** (reading resumes, reading applications, conducting interviews) **per hire.** ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64776&key=user_uploads/122083/ea0fe803-d00c-447f-9cf6-66b58c6a491c) We recommend benchmarking Loop with your top employees. Then, you can use our platform to identify job applicants with similar skills 🙂 ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64776&key=user_uploads/122083/4a8ab797-5de5-4d1b-8b2d-915eb18750b0) In building this for our own company, we learned a couple unexpected things: 1. **Great candidates don’t necessarily have relevant experience.** Top performers come from an incredibly wide range of backgrounds. Our very best agent used to edit a niche industry newsletter. 2. We increased our interview-to-hire rate from 18% to 48%. As a direct result, we became happier people, less cynical and Malthusian. It’s a joke, but it’s also real. ### OK, I’m interested in being a happier person Great! [Sign up here](https://www.loopsupport.com) and use the code LAUNCHYC for a 49% discount off your first month.

AccessOwl: Automate SaaS access for your employees,"**tl;dr AccessOwl automates how your employees receive access to SaaS tools. Provision any tool, no matter what API is available. IT teams from companies like Zeplin save 30 minutes on every access request.** ## **📜 The Story** Manually creating software accounts, documenting it in Gsheets and rushing through dozens of tools with every offboarding. Those are struggles we faced time over time when building prior startups. Available solutions only cover a fraction of the tools and require expensive upgrades to enterprise-subscriptions ([SSO.Tax](http://SSO.Tax)). That’s why we built an easy-to-use tool with a Slack-UI that every employee knows how to work with and bundled it with unmatched provisioning capabilities (hundreds of apps!). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64758&key=user_uploads/165231/b1769bda-60e3-4cf9-9085-59489077abd7) ## **❌ The Problem** 1. **30 minutes wasted for every Access Request**: Your workforce needs to request, approve, provision, communicate & document for every single access request 2. **Enterprise subscriptions needed**: Other solutions only work with specific APIs (SCIM/SAML) for which the highest enterprise subscription is needed (”SSO Tax”). 3. **Compliance & Security**: Documenting who has access to what is a manual and tedious process that never is 100% accurate ## **✨ The Solution** 1. **Automated workflows in Slack**: On- & Offboardings, Access Requests and Approvals all handled directly in Slack. Stop the JIRA ticket-flood - saving your workforce time and nerves. 2. **Provisioning & Permissioning**: AccessOwl is the future of Access Management. It handles all account changes (creation, deletion, updates) for all SaaS applications. The best: It works no matter what API is available. 3. **Stay SOX, SOC2, HiPAA, ISO27001 compliant:** Full Audit-trail about who has access to what and ability to schedule recurring Access Reviews. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64758&key=user_uploads/165231/22da2853-f0c9-4beb-afd3-0d940596e675) ## ⚡ **How it Works** 1. **Install it in Slack:** Give your employees access in one single click 2. **App Discovery & Sync**: Let AccessOwl discover all applications used by your team by connecting to your Google Workspace 3. **Start (De)Provisioning**: Have AccessOwl automate all of your provisioning and deprovisioning tasks ## 🌐 **Integrations** AccessOwl already works with over 100+ applications.

Meticulous: The easiest way to write end-to-end tests,"Hey there! I'm Gabe and I'm super excited to share [Meticulous](https://meticulous.ai/) with you today, the easiest way to create end-to-end tests, without writing (or maintaining) any code. What is Meticulous? Meticulous is a CLI tool with ‘record’, ‘simulate’ and ‘test’ commands. The record command opens an instrumented browser which records your actions as you interact with your web application. Watch the record command below: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64757&key=user_uploads/155134/7b3e6754-07fe-424f-9896-1ba0b78f513a) The simulate command re-executes the recorded sequence of actions on a URL of your choice, like localhost . A test consists of a recording ID (which identifies the recording to simulate on the new version of code) and a simulation ID. Tests are defined and maintained in a meticulous.json file. Meticulous takes a visual snapshot at the end of each simulation and a test fails if there is a discrepancy between the two snapshots. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64757&key=user_uploads/155134/cda27a4d-831e-4a25-b884-20583a4832f2) Watch the test command in action below: ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64757&key=user_uploads/155134/484ba0aa-628b-4885-a341-f55e4a2daf2b) ### What about flows that mutate state? Imagine a test that simulates a user signing up to your application. You can't sign up twice with the same email address. Traditionally you have two options: 1) Write a mock for the network call 2) Introduce a mechanism for resetting state after each test execution. Meticulous solves this problem by providing an option to automatically mock out all network calls, eliminating the need for either of these approaches. This option should be used if you wish to isolate the frontend. ### How can I try this? Sign up [here](https://app.meticulous.ai/) and try out the product (no credit card required), or check out the [docs](https://docs.meticulous.ai) here. On a related note, I started offering testing office hours to YC founders. I’d be happy to help you out, even if you’re not a YC founder and it's just to strategize around your testing strategy. Just email [gabe](mailto:gabe@meticulous.ai) with the title ‘Testing office hours request’.",Gabriel Spencer-Harper,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/21c231501ab487aeebd423be36b5cc509779ee42.jpg,Otherimage_24508_1.jpg;Otherimage_24508_2.jpg;Otherimage_24508_3.jpg;,24508

Momentu: democratizing mental health in Latin America,"Hey! We are JP Montoya and Noam Grebler and we are democratizing mental health access in LATAM. **Why does it matter?** 75% of LATAM employees are facing a mental health challenge, but unfortunately, less than 25% are able to get the support they need. **This is what we do better than anyone else** We address mental health challenges in employees by providing them 1-1 coaching, therapy, digital content, and more. As a result, we improve employee productivity, satisfaction and we reduce turnover. In just 1 year since launching, we are already working with top companies in LATAM such as La Haus, Clara, Grupo Ecopetrol, Grupo Bolivar and Axa Colpatria, covering employees in +11 countries. **Why on earth did we decide to build this?** Mental health is really close to us. JP evidenced how seeking support was a difficult challenge when he almost lost his best friend due to mental health challenges, while Noam started 6 years ago a mental health organization that provided peer to peer support to college students in USA. A Mental Health VC introduced us a year ago. Working on democratizing mental health in LATAM was a no brainer for us. **How to get started** We are offering YC Companies 1 free month access to our platform + 15 1-1 sessions (therapy & coaching) Please drop us a message to [jpmontoya@momentu.co](mailto:jpmontoya@momentu.co) and I will personally onboard your company into our Momentu Experience.",Noam Grebler Farras,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/9dc1263b637b2322c3d226f77c8f95d14b82aa49.jpg,,27151

Time and time again I’ve painfully collected unverified images of insurance cards and dec pages while leveraging tools like Microblink and Acuant to capture and verify identity documents. I reached out to a few more operators in our network and quickly validated that they were facing the same issue, so I partnered with Nihar to build Axle: a painless way for consumers to link their insurance data to companies they trust. ### **Get started today!** Looking to save time on insurance verification & monitoring and offering a seamless experience for your customers?

This fast turnaround in data processing > model training > evaluation > simulation > metrics generation > deployment was enabled by talented ML Engineers using **state-of-the-art pipelining tools**. ## Your problem If you are an **ML/DS developer** 🧑‍💻, you likely spend a lot of time battling obscure infrastructure instead of leveraging your core competency: extracting insights and predictions from data. If you are a **business leader** 🧑‍💼, you likely want more models to grow and optimize your business; and retrain them frequently to adapt to ever-changing world conditions (hello COVID!). Existing solutions (e.g. Kubeflow, Argo, Airflow, Prefect) are still too low-level and not usable by ML/DS developers. Tools such as Ruby on Rails and Heroku enabled generations of web developers to build prototypes into unicorns. **Where is that experience for ML/DS development?** ## Our solution [Sematic Beta Launch Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0Hj0T-bbiY) [Sematic](https://sematic.dev/) is **a lightweight** [**open-source**](https://github.com/sematic-ai/sematic) **ML/DS pipeline development and execution framework based on learnings from working at Cruise**.

👋 🔎 Hello Cognition: Search Engine for Developers,"### TL;DR: Hello searches and understands technical sources for you, giving you actionable explanations and suggestions for your technical problems. Hey YC, we’re Michael and Justin - excited to launch [Hello Cognition](https://beta.sayhello.so/) today! ### Problem Software engineering runs on ad-hoc know-hows - the most valuable information is either in technical documentation or scattered around discussion boards and blogs. Google is too broad and shallow of a search tool to be great at suggesting actionable technical solutions. Understanding information about a complex technical problem still involves a lot of manual time and effort. ### Solution Hello is a search engine that extracts understanding + code examples from technical sources, bringing you information you can immediately act upon to make progress on the problem you’re working on. ### Our Story For our honors theses at UT Austin, we researched prototypes of large generative language models that can answer complex questions by combining information from multiple sources. Training a sequence-to-sequence language model (T5 derivative) on our custom dataset designed for factual generation yielded much better results with less hallucination. After creating this prototype, we started actively developing Hello with the idea that searching should be just like talking to a smart friend. ### How it works When you submit a query, we pull and rerank raw site data from Bing, then extract understanding with our proprietary large language models. For extracting and ranking code snippets, we use BERT-based models. We finally use seq-to-seq transformer models to simplify all this input into a final explanation. ### Search Examples ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/984097/02a5182f-a1ce-4f3f-b6bd-d662ea7f7478) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/984097/e2bd8155-8d29-45f9-84e9-669c69909197) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/984097/97d8104e-cda8-4536-9be8-08573d2d895f) ### [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/) Ask Start asking your technical questions at [sayhello.so](http://sayhello.so)!

Payment options are inflexible for crucial SaaS tools and professional services. 2. Monthly repayments required lengthy negotiation and often a 20%+ premium. 3. Large invoices are usually offline, email based journeys. ## Payment options for the big stuff suck 1. SaaS companies want recurring revenue upfront and Services have limited cash flow to defer payments. Customers want to spread large invoices. It’s always a negotiation. 2. SaaS companies & Services can’t offer credit (risk, regulation, etc). 3. Credit cards don’t work for larger items:\\ \\- SaaS companies and Services won’t accept them due to high fees\\ \\- They provide only short term improvement to a buyer’s cashflow ## Collect revenue now & offer flexibility to your customers 1.

"MovingLake: Realtime, event-driven data connectors","Hey YC! [Edgar Cabrera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edgarcabrera-dev/) and [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrespaezmartinez/) are excited to launch [Moving Lake](https://movinglake.com/) today. **TLDR: MovingLake aims to do ETLs for event-driven architectures. Power your data warehouse as well as your microservices using the same API connectors.** ### ⚠️ **What’s the Problem?** After talking to dozens of data engineers as well as technology stakeholders, and from our past experience, we uncovered a set of intertwined problems with current data connectors: 1. A data connector does not provide data to transactional systems. This can lead to duplication of integration work plus lack of reliability between different sources of data. For machine learning this can be real trouble 2. API integrations done in house are flaky and require a lot of investment in development and maintenance 3. Event-driven architectures are reimplementing over and over again the same pieces of infrastructure such as schedulers, pollers and webhook receivers 4. Batch extractors can skip states and so end up with missing data. For example if I have a booking business and a reservation gets cancelled 10 minutes after created, the batch pipeline will only see the cancelled state but not the created state. 5. Running automations and other workflows is impossible with batch data connectors. ### 👍 **What’s the solution?** **Realtime, event-driven, deduplicated, replayable, ELT friendly and SDK ready connectors which feed both data and transactional systems at the same time.**\\ We are rolling out connector for APIs which give you the ability to add any number of destinations including data and backend systems. We provide on top of that transformations for the data side so that you get the data in nicely formatted tables. Plus we also aim to provide easy to use SDKs so that consuming MovingLake’s webhooks is as easy and fast as possible.\\ \\ ❓ **What’s the ask?** Do you have recurring issues with data reliability? Do you end up writing batch scripts to recover lost data from webhooks? Do you struggle with running your machine learning models from batch pipeline’s data?

As your team gives a demo, we automatically show the relevant talking points for **this specific prospect** and **this specfic feature** so your team is always selling the best value during their conversations. We also: * **Track what features are really demoed** so your product team knows what’s really happening in the field. Faster feedback means more efficient dev cycles. * **Timestamp all actions** so you don’t need to watch the whole recording to revisit that aha moment.  Nobody wants to rewatch their entire sales call. * **Inject collateral straight into demos** so you can show a single slide while you show the feature to keep the conversation on topic.  Nobody can remember the 30 slides you showed at the start of the call. Also works with videos & webpages if you’re fancy. * **Sync with your Google calendar** so you don’t have to manually time check yourself. And you don’t forget who’s in the call! * **Customized talk track per persona** so you’re talking about the value that matters to this customer against their current tool. Give them the data that’s relevant to them. * Easily **give feedback for sales enablement** so the content stays applicable. Helps your enablement team help closers close. * **Search talking points inline** so you never get stumped by a question. Now you don’t need to book a second meeting, you can close them today. And it does all that seamlessly from whatever account you use to demo: a sandbox, a rep’s account or even the customer’s own data. ## Who it’s for: Teams selling a SaaS tool, especially ones with great products facing the following challenges: * Onboarding new account executives and sales engineers faster * Founders looking to hand off sales to someone who hasn’t been living the product for years * Struggling to hire enough sales engineers to support your AEs * CSMs struggling to get renewals excited about expanding or upselling because they can’t show what’s new ## We’d love to hear from you!

The system was handling multi-million dollar $$ revenue at its peak. > > BUT we made mistakes and suffered, because it's really hard to do it right! We had undercharged major clients by several millions in a year, and over charged other customers significant amount of money, which resulted in some penalty as well. (We've interviewed other companies and they faced the same issues, so it's not just our poor engineering! ﻿🙂﻿) It's unnecessary that every Data, Infra and Platform SaaS company has to build the similar billing system like we did!

🔥SilkChart: Turn product data into revenue growth 💸,"**TL;DR** SilkChart helps growth teams improve campaigns based on what users are doing in product - without relying on expensive data scientists.

Striga - Crypto and Banking APIs,"Hello YC, Prashanth here, from Striga. Striga is a set of APIs that allows you to blend **banking infrastructure and crypto infrastructure** **in a way** **that works for your application**, without requiring you to need a license or compliance team of any sort. For instance, you can issue a Visa card and link it to a USDT or Bitcoin account, or you can simply onboard users and generate unique USDC deposit addresses to build compliant on/off ramps.\\ \\ Check out the documentation here - [docs.striga.com](https://docs.striga.com/) ### **What Striga Fixes** Building and launching a crypto application that uses traditional financial services (such as card issuing/banking) is either compliance intensive, expensive, constrained or unavailable. We shipped the first ever Bitcoin LN powered payment card which took nearly 2.5 years to come to fruition, simply because banks refused to work with us or give us the room we needed to innovate. Instead, we ended up having to build two separate mobile applications powered by two different banks, connected via the lightning network. Those same APIs evolved into what Striga is today. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/590685/29cffa6d-39b1-4665-af3c-f2b7e0bf67d5) If you are building a payments application or anything that requires on/off ramps or secure crypto custody/trading, I encourage you to try building on Striga - We’ve seen prototypes built in less than 24 hours!

⭐️ 🔍 Andi - Search for the next generation,"### TL;DR Instead of a page of blue links, Andi gives you answers. It uses language models combined with live data to answer questions and summarize information based on the top sources. Hey Fam, we're Angie and Jed and we're building [Andi](http://andisearch.com/). We're on a mission to unbreak the Internet and save the world from spam and ad tech. ### **❌ The Problem** It’s become harder to find what you need online. Search is broken because results are overwhelmed with ads, clickbait, and low-quality content marketing. Even when the information you need is in there somewhere, you have to trawl through pages of links to content often buried behind ads and paywalls. --- ## **✨ Our Solution** Andi is a new type of search engine with an intelligent AI assistant that answers complex questions directly. It has a simple chat interface with visual cards. It's like messaging a smart friend who acts as an intermediary to online knowledge, and keeps you safe and productive online. ### ⚙️ **How it works** Andi combines large language models with live data, reasoning and common sense. It's like a search of vertical searches and APIs. We use AI to understand questions and predict the best places to find answers, applying blacklist and quality filters. We retrieve and use live content in real time with semantic search ranking, rather than returning outdated information from stale models or a static keyword index.  ## **💙 Community fave features** 👉 Get direct answers to questions ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/673843/4fe6c540-657b-4299-a362-a39ebd481748) 👉 Visual results (a picture is worth 1,000 words!) ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/673843/5723b727-30f2-4473-b9fb-46b3376c9cf8) 👉 Reader mode: See content free from ads and clutter ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64519&key=user_uploads/673843/2f8a8522-6c43-4880-a013-bfb0e7e6dcb1) ### **🙏 Asks** Try Andi!

Garage: Wholesale auto parts marketplace for Africa's 2M+ retailers,"Hello YC Family This is Gana and Cedric, Co-founders at [Garage](https://www.garagemobility.com/). **At Garage, we are building the wholesale marketplace for auto parts in Africa** **Backstory** Cedric and I are ex-founders with experience building, scaling and investing in startups in Africa. I used to buy and ship auto parts to my dad in Cameroon and realized that the landing cost once those parts arrived in Cameroon was still cheaper than buying locally. We realized that this issue was due to inefficiencies across the supply chain for parts distribution. Garage aims to solve this problem by building a wholesale marketplace that will power the $25B after sales market in Africa. **The Problem** Over $25B in auto parts sales in Africa occur at neighborhood retail shops. These retail shop owners are the backbone of the aftersales market yet they struggle to survive because * They have no visibility into which suppliers have which parts * Multiple layers of middle men and low buying power lead to inflated and volatile pricing * They don’t have enough working capital to grow their businesses **The Solution** Garage is a wholesale auto parts distributor for Africa, supporting these retailers. We aggregate parts from the largest suppliers in the world and deliver directly to retailers. We are building the largest auto tech platform to reduce the cost of car ownership in Africa by making auto parts more affordable and accessible.",Gwanygha’a Gana,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c8260028903386f91b680a157e6d1b5778b3a640.jpg,,26907
Journalize.io: Developer-Friendly Financial Reporting,"For companies with large transaction volumes, it’s almost impossible to produce accurate, auditable financials. It’s not hard to see why: developers aren’t experts in financial reporting, and finance teams rarely have dedicated engineers. Journalize fixes all of this. ### What Journalize Does 1. For developers, it’s easy to stream transaction data into our platform. 2. For finance teams, we quickly perform calculations (such as revenue deferrals) when data enters our system. 3. For auditors, we keep a log that _even includes the line of code_ used to generate data. Searchable by user, invoice, or any other dimension. ### Motivation I’ve led for several ERP implementations in my career - and I’ve always left soon after. I’ve seen IPOs delayed due to “material differences”. We never want to see a firm pay 1M+ for ERP consultants again, or spend the first week of every month scrambling to close the books. Journalize was created as a collaboration between engineers and CPAs. ### For Developers Journalize provides a client library in most languages for collecting financial transaction data. It’s as easy as adding a logging statement, and built to handle double-digit millions of transactions. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64489&key=user_uploads/52962/7ceb0e19-335f-4092-b6d5-db82040c993e) ### For Finance Teams and Analysts Once data is flowing to Journalize, you may perform different kinds of aggregations and analysis. Find discrepancies, FIFO, subscription waterfalls, and report by MTD/YTD. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64489&key=user_uploads/52962/4b3d02a7-687a-4eb0-b3fa-eb97fb666e57) Rather than implementing these calculations within Excel or complex SQL queries, Journalize continuously runs these calculations when new data is added. GL entries are available within minutes rather than hours. ### For Auditors Easily look up any order, customer, or invoice and see all associated transactions. Journalize also instruments the _exact line of code_ that generated a number. This makes it easy to see the exact sequence of events, and removes the pain of debugging why a number doesn’t “look right”. # Asks If you’re a data analyst or developer who is responsible for financial reporting, we’d love to hear from you! If you’re a financial controller or auditor, we’d love to learn about how you’re managing this today. You can reach us at [founders@journalize.io](mailto:founders@journalize.io). We’d love your feedback on what we’re building, your rants about what’s broken in today’s world, and would love for you to give Journalize a spin.",Jay Goel,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/bb038a64469e3f489617ca3a346180136897a47a.jpg,Otherimage_24304_1.jpg;Otherimage_24304_2.jpg;,24304
🛋 Apply Design - Shopify for Property Listings,"[Apply Design](https://applydesign.io/) helps homeowners sell their property 30% faster with a 5% higher price. We do this through our custom website creator that showcases your home's potential in a way that is personalized to the buyer. For example, when a young married couple with a baby visits the website we host, instead of seeing a dull property listing on Zillow with empty pictures or old furniture, the family sees realistic and personalized virtual interior designs – such as a home office and a baby room – which we automatically generate for them. They can then play with those designs and see how that home fits their needs and tastes.\\ \\ We entered the market with a product that allows anyone to create virtual realistic interior designs for empty property images automatically. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64479&key=user_uploads/1014282/0c4976d5-00b5-45dd-85c0-decb4111d476) ### **The Problem** An excellent online property listing can help you sell your property faster and for a higher price. But property listing websites haven’t changed for the last 20 years and are very one-dimensional, although prospective buyers have different needs and tastes. By using computer graphics and ML, Apply Design created a way to automatically create realistic virtual interior designs that enable the homeowner to easily create a website that showcases the home's potential in a way that is personalized to the buyer. A way that sells better than Zillow. ### **About Us** Yaniv Knoll and I are based in Tel Aviv and met in the IDF in a small intelligence unit specializing in 3D solutions for special operations. Our work was recognized with the highest intelligence award for 2015.\\ For the last 10 years, we’ve built 3D and computer vision-based solutions in military, HR, construction, and real estate. The idea was born last year when my parents tried to sell the apartment that I grew up in. A month went by with no offers after the empty pictures sat on Zillow waiting for anyone to show interest, so I created a dedicated website showing how the home fits different family structures and purposes, using editable interior realistic designs for each room of the house. Within days of prospective buyers using our product, we went from no offers to three, and a 10% higher asking price than expected. ### **I want it! How do I try it?** In case you have or plan to publish a property listing (or if you just want to test it out, it's really fun! ), you can try our first product at [applydesign.io](http://applydesign.io), which allows you to upload an image and add realistic furniture to show the potential of your property.\\ The best part is that the first image is for free 💸! --- If you do try it out, make sure to **send me feedback** about the experience and the potential you see. **_If you know any realtors, property managers, or even friends and family who are about to sell or rent a property, please tell them about Apply Design. 🙂_** Thanks!",Asaf Amit,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/ab9569df888c9a5622cb389369898e05bec598e2.jpg,Otherimage_26802_1.jpg;,26802

🚀 Openpod - Incentivize developer contributions and fundraise quickly for OSS projects,"**TL;DR** Imagine if you had been able to buy Ubuntu tokens when it first launched… **Openpod is a DAO-as-a-service platform for open-source projects to incentivize developer contribution and make fundraising easy**. Projects can use these governance/utility tokens to compensate developers for their work, let early investors/speculators purchase these tokens, and reward their community. **Check us out here:** \\ [openpod.io](http://openpod.io)\\ [app.openpod.io](http://app.openpod.io) ### **Problem:** Launch ramps for open source projects are broken. * It’s hard to get funding as a new or up-and-coming open source project, even if you have believers. Most of the available funds and donations are often taken by the top open source projects.  * Maintaining consistent contributions from developers is tough since they are volunteering their time. They are also not compensated for work they did in the early phases of a project - even if it's a successful one. * It’s tough to get people to use your product early on.   ### **Our Solution:** DAOs have long been a solution in search of a problem. **Open source projects are inherently decentralized and function as communities, which are hallmarks of DAOs.** Openpod is a **DAO-as-a-service platform** for open source projects to establish their own DAO and mint utility tokens. Developers, users, and believers can purchase these tokens on our platform, and **get in early on potential growth** of the project and the token value. They’ll also be able to vote on new features and how the raised funding has been used. Meanwhile, the project can use this immediate funding for development.  We’re adding Github integration with DAOs so that **when developers commit or push to a project’s repos, they’ll get automatically compensated** based on the bounties associated with their tasks.  ### **Backstory:** As developers who have worked on open source projects previously, we’ve seen some of the best and brightest people get burnt out while doing work for little to no compensation - especially when these projects are new. So we feel it's only fair to **let developers have a way to earn returns on their hard effort** in the project. ### **Our Ask:** We’d love to pilot the DAO creation platform with fellow YC companies! If you have a Github repository, and **a few cents to spare**, create your very own tokens for your project. **You could use these tokens to incentivize your early users, contributors, and have more people support you as a project.**  We’re working on integrations to let token holders **redeem the tokens for Open Core/SaaS credits or other perks** **to ensure your tokens will have value**. Users could also sell their tokens to make returns. \\ [openpod.io](http://openpod.io) \\ [app.openpod.io](http://app.openpod.io)",Simar Kohli,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/2291c5cae383a9cb4ce445d58ed5a32bae1e2f5b.jpg,,26722

Chat with me about #pregnancyresearch #studyinclusivity #trialdesign #bias # What is diabetes in pregnancy and why does it matter? 🧐 Roughly [1 in 6 births](https://www.idf.org/our-activities/care-prevention/gdm) are affected by some sort of hyperglycemia - or high blood sugar - in pregnancy, with the average annual economic burden around [$6k per case](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30940641/). Further, [50% of women](https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/basics/gestational.html) with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) will go on to develop type II diabetes, which costs 1 in 7 U.S. healthcare dollars today. We started working on this after our cofounder, Mika, developed GDM in pregnancy and was told her son was in the 99th percentile growth range and would likely need a C-section to be delivered. Luckily, she was able to manage her GDM through diligent tracking, trigger identification and diet changes, and now we are bringing this knowledge to help millions of other women who experience the same anxiety, panic and isolation each year. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64437&key=user_uploads/972065/ede51043-7ada-46cf-8816-74861dcc7e4a) Short-term risks of GDM include a 1.5x greater likelihood of requiring an emergency C-section, and a 1.4x greater likelihood of preterm birth. For babies of mothers with GDM, there is an increased risk of cardiac defects, and lifelong metabolic abnormalities. Diabetes during pregnancy has also increased significantly in recent years. [Recent studies](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/diabetes-during-pregnancy.htm) found that from 2000 to 2010, **the percentage of pregnant women with gestational diabetes increased 56%** while the percentage of women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes before pregnancy increased 37%.

🧪 Signatur Biosciences diagnoses anything with a simple PCR test.,"**tl;dr:** Signatur Biosciences is a B2B molecular diagnostics design company. Our technology expands PCR testing to a whole new range of conditions. We design smart PCR kits that can detect complex diseases as easily as a COVID test, using standard qPCR machines. Our tests seamlessly integrate into existing clinical workflows and ubiquitous laboratory instruments, empowering us to become _the_ enabling technology platform for a $20B industry. 👋 Hey everyone! We’re Celestin and John. We are determined to transform the state of medical diagnostics. We set out to find a solution that delivers state-of-the art diagnosis on ubiquitous instrumentation to put cutting-edge healthcare within the reach of everyone, everywhere. ### **The Problem.** Right now, PCR testing is limited to simple diseases. Covid is a good example. You take a sample from a patient and look for one biomarker. If the biomarker is there, the patient has the disease; no biomarker, no disease. Simple. But most conditions aren't that simple. There’s a $20B industry using _patterns_ of multiple biomarkers that diagnose complex diseases, but to deploy their tests they’re relying on legacy technologies that are too slow and expensive to really help people, limiting their market reach. ### **🧬 Signatur Biosciences’s solution.** Our platform expands PCR testing to a whole new range of conditions, beyond just infectious disease to include everything from chronic diseases, treatment selection, and disease monitoring. We have re-engineered the molecular architecture of the polymerase chain reaction, empowering it to process the information from multiple biomarkers simultaneously. We combine the power of gene signature diagnosis with the **_ease and familiarity of a single PCR reaction._** Every biomedical lab in the planet is equipped with PCR machines. This was true before the pandemic. But as a response to the pandemic, the PCR testing capacity in the US has increased by 5500% (3000% in the UK). We are giving those machines something new to do. ### **🚀 How can Signatur Biosciences help me?** We are partnering with companies to design our platform around their biomarker panels, offering broader market reach bringing such tests to more patients. In parallel, we are building our own assay portfolio. We are developing our own internal pipeline of tests to tackle diseases that can only be interrogated by our technology. ### **How you can help.** We are looking for introductions to companies in the molecular diagnostics space. This could be companies developing portable hardware. Specifically developing genomic testing, or assays based on gene expression analysis.",Celestin de Wergifosse,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/21175fb3644f2f8fd7550c0996f6527758d38389.jpg,,26751
Mailmodo: Email marketing platform for higher email engagement,"I am Aquibur, founder and CEO of Mailmodo, where we are reinventing emails to help marketers get better ROI and engagement. ### The problem with today’s email marketing Even though emails are affordable, effective, and personalized at scale, unfortunately, they're not built to encourage user conversions.  Long user journeys from email to website/landing pages result in low conversions and limit emails as just channels for information exchange. Moreover, even though other mediums have evolved, emails are still the same since their beginning. ### Unleashing Email 3.0 Mailmodo cuts through this long journey and allows your emails to get higher engagement and conversions using unique emails powered by interactive widgets and a centralized platform that creates, sends, automates and measures email campaigns of all kinds! With Mailmodo you can add a live poll, calculator, or a spin-the-wheel widget to engage customers. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64413&key=user_uploads/463208/49c88bc9-f910-4c67-8d24-884382ddbf7b) You can even gamify your emails with a live quiz. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64413&key=user_uploads/463208/e0a2313c-c456-4034-acbc-4eac1ece2fbe) You can enable reservation or appointment bookings inside emails ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64413&key=user_uploads/463208/1a70e0ff-b372-40e3-9e02-d07c24626a37) And get reviews and responses from customers inside their inboxes. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64413&key=user_uploads/463208/131dcaff-6d8d-4de9-8c14-b20d05810a15) Mailmodo is a complete platform for all your email marketing needs in addition to the superior email experience and conversions that you get.

"Plutto, business background checks for LatAm","“I’m sorry but we’re not going to accept your investment. At the moment we’re not taking business clients”. This was the answer we got from a fintech that got us to start Plutto right away. ### **Hey YC!** We’re Antonia, Ignacio, Felipe and Sebastián and we’re the co-founders of Plutto! **We help financial services to verify and validate their business customer in minutes for LatAm.** ### **So, what’s the problem?** Business information is all over the place in LatAm. If you’re a fintech, bank, payment company, or basically anyone who needs to onboard B2B clients, chances are you spend a lot of time gathering information to know who you are dealing with, and sometimes, to be compliant with the law. This process is called Know Your Business (KYB). This a **time-consuming and expensive** process that usually involve lawyers and other people to be completed. **A business can wait up to 3 months to open a bank account in Chile** and other countries in LatAm. We allow our clients to solve this problem in a fast and automated way. ### **How does it work?** The only thing we need is your client’s company registration number (TIN equivalent) and we **gather the information for you**. This can be done using our dashboard or API. We also help our customers to request private documents that can’t be obtained from any source providing a white label on-boarding form. We also process and review the information of this documents so they don’t have to be manually reviewed. The outcome is a company profile with all the information, documents and on-boarding steps our clients need **to make a solid decision.** ### **This is something that had to be done!** In previous experiences we struggled with this problem, paying up to $100 per customer on-boarding and waiting weeks until they were done. Some of our clients take less than 10 minutes to validate their users and we charge between 6-20 bucks for it. As we hinted at the start, we once tried to invest our company’s money in a Chilean fintech and get rejected because they were not accepting business clients due to this issue. Absolute madness. We started on this idea the following day. # How can you help us? At the moment we’re working with our first 6 clients in Chile and we’re looking to expand to other LatAm countries. Specially Perú, Colombia and Mexico so any of the following **introductions or meetings** will be much appreciated: * People who **work in the on-boarding or legal team** in a B2B LatAm fintech. * Someone who is **an expert in law and regulation for fintech**, banks or any other business that requires KYB (Know Your Business) in 🇵🇪, 🇨🇴, 🇨🇱 or 🇲🇽. * Any fintech or company that might need our services in the region.",Ignacio Márquez,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/41ca14f3cd19638bf2b82772ff4191cae981864d.jpg,,27047
ReleviumBio - Life changing Innovation,"![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64408&key=user_uploads/854295/770094dd-9ea7-4b87-96db-dfa446ca3b6e) [www.ReleviumBio.com](http://www.ReleviumBio.com) **Problem** \\ There has been no disruptive treatment for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) in over 50 years, with 80% of patients reliant on damaging medications. The shortcomings of the current injectable treatments leave 2 million US patients reliant on opioids for adequate pain relief. The number one KOA patient complaint is pain, with regenerative therapies to date failing to demonstrate a measurable patient outcome. **Solution** \\ Up to recently, it was believed KOA was a disease of wear and tear. The latest scientific evidence however shows it to be a complex whole-organ disease, affecting multiple tissues and with different disease patterns for different patients. This evidence highlights the need for a multimodal approach to effectively treat this complex disease. PeptiFlex is the first multimodal injectable therapeutic developed for KOA that gives not only pain relief but also lubricates and preserves the joint. **How it works** \\ Our novel multimodal therapeutic is based on a peptide component (315y) covalently bound to a polymer gel base. This patent-protected biotherapeutic achieves its effects through three complementary and synergistic effects. The biotherapeutic is injected directly into the knee joint to give immediate long-acting relief. **Pain Relief Effect**: PeptiFlex reduces pain nerve signalling by the action of peptide 315y which safely and consistently reduces pain signalling by a sodium channel block effect on neurons in the knee nerve fibres. Preclinical test data out to 7 weeks in a dedicated KOA model has shown successful translation of efficacy and safety with statistically significant effects on key pain endpoints. **Lubrication Effect**: The polymer base of PeptiFlex has unique viscoelastic properties acting as a substitute for healthy joint fluid and providing lubrication, cushioning, shock absorption, and improving the physical function of the joint. **Protection Effect**: PeptiFlex has proven to be extremely safe and protects joint structure by cartilage protecting actions of peptide 315y. The peptide interacts with cartilage-producing cells (chondrocytes) to cause proliferation and increased cartilage production. Tests have shown KOA joints treated with PeptiFlex were evaluated using the gold standard OARSI cartilage scoring system and showed improvement in terms of aggression and extent of disease compared to control. **The ask** \\ If you know any strategics interested in osteoarthritis or clinical trial groups interested in partnering with early-stage companies, we would really appreciate an introduction",Alison Liddy,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/5b2a3ec2cb7d9a78b37837da2196318376af434d.jpg,Otherimage_27168_1.jpg;,27168

Infra: Open-source Infrastructure Access,"### **What Is Infra?** [Infra](https://github.com/infrahq/infra) is a service for managing access to cloud infrastructure. It gives team members fine-grained access to Kubernetes (with support for SSH, Databases, AWS, and more coming soon). It’s open-source, easy to deploy and plugs into your existing single sign-on software such as Okta or Google. **Check out the GitHub repo:** [**https://github.com/infrahq/infra**](https://github.com/infrahq/infra) ### **The Problem** When more than a single user need to access infrastructure such as Kubernetes, access management invariably becomes a problem. Many teams share credentials, or simply give every user on the team admin access (or no access at all!). This has obvious drawbacks: there is no audit log for who did what, and even the most well-intentioned user can wreak havoc by mistake. Even with dedicated accounts and scoped permissions, most infrastructure services issue long-lived credentials by default, meaning users may continue to have access after they leave the team or no longer need it. ### **How it works** **Log in with Okta, Google** Users authenticate with Infra via a single command in their terminal using their existing credentials from Okta, Google or Azure AD. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/661559/5338833e-b5e2-463f-8fc8-ca658b4d3689) **Discover & access infrastructure** After logging in, team members can list and get access to infrastructure in single place. Infra also automatically sets up local credentials and configuration files: _no more stale credentials!_ ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/661559/99c079c6-3383-43ad-a806-91bf77f76e0a) **Fine-grained access control** In the Infra Dashboard, admins can assign fine-grained access for users or groups. Infra also includes a REST API for teams who want to manage access programmatically or via their own tooling. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/661559/2d11b2c8-0382-4847-aebb-160164d3627c) **Deploy anywhere** Infra’s open-source and can be deployed anywhere that runs Kubernetes or Docker. While it is self-hosted today, we’re working on a cloud version that doesn’t involve managing or upgrading Infra. And the CLI runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Interested in trying it out? [We’d love to hear from you](mailto:contact@infrahq.com). ### **Who we are** The team behind Infra previously built Docker Desktop & Docker Hub, 1Password, VMware, Datadog and HashiCorp Consul. In our past lives, customers often told us managing and auditing infrastructure access was a huge, unsolved problem: to the point where most teams don’t even give access to users who need it, or they give too much access. Together we set out to solve this problem. ### **Get Infra** * [Check out the repo](https://github.com/infrahq/infra) * View our [Quickstart](https://infrahq.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart) documentation * Interested in trying our Cloud product?

Weltio - Wealth Management platform designed for Latin America,"Hey everyone! We are excited to launch [Weltio](https://weltio.com/) - a low cost platform designed for Latam users to open a brokerage account in US dollars for investment in US equities and 20+ cryptocurrencies. Weltio is built on an API first model that allows us to focus on the user experience by building features for the middleware and front end. **The Problem** There is a historical challenge to create and transfer wealth through generations in Latin America.  There is a lack of access to world-class assets for the middle and middle-upper classes, costs are high, education is low, and customer experience is lagging behind advanced economies.  In the past 30 years, investing in the US markets has yielded a 5x benefit (adjusted for inflation), while in Mexico, as an example, yields negative returns.   The chart below summarizes how big the overall disparity of investment outcomes between the investing in local assets vs. global assets: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1007350/c3c8fb28-46bf-4251-abc6-1f397e15bd0a) **The Solution** Weltio allows users to open a brokerage account in the US in less than 5 minutes with a smooth onboarding process.  Once the account is open, users can fund their accounts with a domestic wire (in our initial geography Mexico, wires are made in MXN).  The user then receives a deposit in USD in their account in less than 30 minutes!  From their account they can invest in stocks and ETFs and buy/sell cryptocurrencies (20+ available) - we have zero cost for trading and have a very competitive commissions structure for crypto.  Additionally, we believe it is our duty to enable our users to make the best investment decisions by providing essential information and education modules for them to make the best decisions. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/1007350/4b06e230-dfb5-401f-88d0-0913e7c64b0b) **Background on the Idea and Founders** Weltio started in fall 2021, but the desire to give access to high-quality financial services to people in Latin America started years before that.  David has spent most of his professional career as a consultant for McKinsey and Oliver Wyman, advising financial institutions in more than 15 countries in 4 continents, where he has seen, first-hand, the vast difference in financial products and services offered.  George spent several years as a consultant for McKinsey, also advising financial institutions.  After deciding to leave for tech, he joined Wayfair and Klarna in Berlin, where he developed expertise in product.  David and George met more than 10 years ago at McKinsey, where they worked together on several projects and have remained good friends since then.  **Asks for the Community** Download the platform and tell us your thoughts! Although the platform is for now only covering Mexico, feedback on the platform helps us build a world-class product, ping us directly and we can provide a test-user account. If you or someone you know offers API based investing, or yield as a service please reach out! We’d love to connect and explore a potential partnership going forward.  **Reach Out** Feel free to reach out to us on social media: Instagram (@weltioapp), Facebook (/weltioapp), twitter (@weltioapp), LinkedIn (Weltio) or at: [founders@weltio.com](mailto:founders@weltio.com)",David Abusaid,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c12e4d1409d329c4cabd79349bda195268e3c037.jpg,Otherimage_26659_1.jpg;Otherimage_26659_2.jpg;,26659
evoly — Smart metering as a service,"**TL;DR** At **evoly, we make smart meters for electric, water & waste use cases.** Our software helps utilities achieve better energy efficiency & lower costs. We're already deployed in Europe & Africa and are looking to find new customers in America. **Problem** Smart metering has been around for years, but it has always been very expensive, hard to deploy and heavy on battery usage. Due to this, more than **65% of utilities in the world still have old gen meters** - they need to be read by a technician on a regular basis to bill you. A Smart meter is an instrumental part when building a smart grid and trying to push for energy efficiency and those challenges are becoming the main priorities as we try to build a greener planet. On waste, we help collectors know the exact level of the bins in their city to optimize collection (less CO2 - less travels) **Solution** At evoly we make smart meters easy to deploy. By developing our own hardware leveraging a unique transmission technology: LoRa we are able to offer an **easy to install, 5 times cheaper smart metering solution.** Our software then helps utilities get 24/7 view on their grid and a wide range of possibilities: \\- Remote meter reading \\- Detecting fraud \\- Turning electricity on and off remotely \\- Time of use pricing **Our Story** During the Covid lockdown, we experienced the limit of old gen meters, as technicians could not come and read them to bill every households. Feeling this pain for the first time ourselves, we tried to solve it in our hometown where we used to go to high school together, before realising that the problem was actually almost everywhere around the globe. Today we help 8 cities (Europe - North Africa) in this transition and are looking to find our first customers in the US. **How you can help** **If you know anyone in the utility space in any country that could find this relevant, please feel free to reach us at** [**founders@evolyenergy.com**](mailto:founders@evolyenergy.com)**.

"DailyBot 🤖 daily stand-ups, automation and chat assistant for work","👋 Mauricio and Sergio from [@DailyBot](https://www.dailybot.com/) here. ### **TL;DR** DailyBot is a bunch of useful add-ons for your chat platform. Plug it into your chat and make Async Work a breeze for your team: * 1- Running async Daily Stand-ups, natively integrated in the chat * 2- Cutting unnecessary meetings with more types of recurring check-ins * 3- Spreading love and team recognition with DailyBot Kudos * 4- Socializing better with watercooler prompts and random 1:1 coffees And developers can build simple in-chat functions for their day-to-day operations, without the need to learn chat-platform-specific APIs. Available on Slack, Discord, MS Teams, G Chat. ### **The problem** Async work is the new way of working for many teams. Most teams use chat in any form with tools like Discord, Slack and others. As chat becomes the main app that workers interact with everyday, it becomes necessary to give it more purposes. New purposes include workflows like team check-ins, surveys, platform notifications, tools for social engagement, or custom commands to trigger actions. Creating all this setup is a hustle: * 1- You have to use many apps, bots, plugins * 2- There is a lot of context switching, management overhead, more subscription fees, and more app fatigue for workers * 3- Most bots are not designed for protecting security and privacy # **DailyBot is the solution** We are building the first super-bot for your chat. DailyBot comes with a bunch of use cases and features, all-in-one. Some workflows include: **Check-ins:** track automatically what your team is up to. You can run async and written updates, agile daily stand-ups, retrospectives, or periodic check-ins like 1:1s. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64310&key=user_uploads/207324/06136816-f0a8-4324-8e8b-db4bb9a0aa81) **Kudos**: give kudos and celebrate actions that contribute to better team culture.

This becomes concerning when you are using dozens of apps to build your team workflows. We are designing DailyBot as a privacy & security first company. DailyBot only requests the minimal API permissions from your chat. It can only process messages that are directed to the bot. We are SOC2 Type II compliant, giving confidence to small and big companies about our work and data management practices. **Join Us!** Get started for free.

🚀 Fieldproxy — Retool for field teams,"**👋 Hi All!** This is [Swaroop](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swaroopcmc/) and [Bala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/balakrishna-balasubramanian-a624a8106/) and we are extremely stoked to launch [Fieldproxy](http://fieldproxy.com/) to the world --- 💡 **Problem** We ran a product development agency prior to this where we had built around 60 internal apps across 20 companies to manage their on-ground teams. These companies were across legacy industries like consumer goods, mining, telecom, pharma and energy. Organisations across these industries have been using archaic decades-old ERP systems to manage their on-ground field teams. These systems are extremely rigid and inflexible. There are very limited options for such companies to choose. 80% of the mobile workforce is deskless, but the majority of the productivity and internal SaaS tools are being built for 20% of desk workers.

🌳 Birch Biosciences — Engineered Enzymes for Plastic Recycling 🌳,"**The problem:** Today, plastic recycling doesn't work.  Less than 9% of plastic is recycled in the United States, a number unchanged over the past 15 years.  The current mechanical recycling process involves melting and reforming plastic at high temperatures, generally resulting in major greenhouse gas emissions while producing low quality plastic at high cost.  This is a major problem as consumers demand more sustainable plastic products, but brands are unable to meet this demand due to sustainability, quality, yield, and price issues with mechanically recycled plastic.  If we don’t develop a circular plastic economy, plastics will be responsible for 15% of global CO2 emissions by 2050. **The solution:** Birch Biosciences is engineering an enzyme-mediated process to recycle plastic. Our high performance enzymes work as “molecular scissors'' at low temperatures to break down plastic polymers into monomer “building blocks,” which can be re-polymerized into high quality recycled plastic products. Birch recycling technology will: * **Reduce** **carbon emissions** associated with plastic recycling by > 70%. * Generate recycled plastic of **equivalent** **quality** **to new plastic**. * Produce recycled plastic at **equal or lower cost** than mechanically recycled plastic. * Increase the variety of plastic products that can be **effectively recycled** Birch’s recycling process enables a true ‘circular’ plastic economy where plastic products are continuously recycled into the same plastic products, rather than being manufactured from oil or gas.  This is especially important as consumers, brands, and our planet demand more sustainable products. **Our technology focus:** Enzymes as “molecular scissors” are the centerpiece of our recycling technology. We discover and develop high performance enzymes using iterative machine learning and quantitative high-throughput screening of novel protein designs. Our technology stack enables design of robust enzymes for industrial scale plastic recycling using a fermentation-like bioprocess. We’re currently focused on engineering enzymes for PET plastics (i.e., beverage bottles, polyester clothing) and polyurethane plastics (i.e., foam for furniture, bedding, insulation). In addition to YC, our technology development is supported by the US Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. **How you can help:** If you or anyone in your network might be interested in learning more or helping out, we would love to chat.  We're especially interested in talking with: * Companies and brands that use PET plastics * Experts in the plastic manufacturing and recycling industry * Operators of recycling facilities * Nonprofits with an interest in sustainability and plastic recycling We can be reached at [founders@birchbiosciences.com](mailto:founders@birchbiosciences.com)",Johan Kers,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/77c9dbc7ddcfc0cea9d901a92e53475050f42ea4.jpg,,26675
🌳 iollo - Live Healthier and Much Longer,"**tl;dr:** We’re a subscription service that helps you live healthier and longer. We measure 500+ molecules in your blood to match you with personalized action plans such as dietary, behavioral, and soon, therapeutic interventions that let you extend your healthy lifespan. Hey everyone! We’re Dan and Brent and we’re excited to share what we’ve been working on at [iollo](https://www.iollo.com/?utm_source=bookface). ### **The problem** When you experience an unusual symptom and visit your doctor, you’re usually asked to take a blood test, where they measure about 10-30 markers for which you probably have to pay expensive fees because you haven't reached your deductible. Though at times useful, you’re then prescribed some medications and given generic recommendations based on your results. But did you know that there is a large collection of molecules that aren't commonly measured in your blood called the metabolome that controls your health and how fast you age, and is approximately 5x more influential than your genetics \\[1\\]? ### **What is the metabolome and why it matters** The metabolome is made up of molecules called metabolites, which are compounds like sugars (e.g., glucose and fructose), fats (e.g., cholesterol), vitamins (e.g., vitamin B12), hormones (e.g., T3 and T4), inflammatory markers (e.g., uric acid) and many more. So far we’ve identified 40,000+ metabolites \\[2\\] in the human blood and they’ve been implicated in how you age \\[3\\] and early signs of 30+ age-related diseases like prostate, breast and colon cancer and many other cancers, neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, heart disease, and many more \\[4\\]. As a bonus, your metabolome can also be used to calculate how fast you’re aging, which is a general indicator of your overall health. The good news is that unlike your genetics, which is fixed from when you’re born, your metabolome can be changed over weeks and months with the right interventions. ### **Why we founded iollo and how it can help** Current clinical labs measure around 30 out of 40,000+ potential markers in your blood, leaving out valuable health information. Until today, measuring the metabolome was exclusively for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. With iollo, you can finally access metabolomics technology to improve your health and age slower. We start by measuring 500+ blood metabolites that capture imbalances in your blood that are relevant to how fast you’re aging and your overall health and match you with dietary, behavioral, and soon, therapeutic interventions that benefit you the most. ### **How it works** 1. Subscribe to iollo 2. Receive an at-home microsampling device to painlessly collect a blood sample (see picture below) 3. Send your sample back, we then measure 500+ metabolites in your sample 4. Based on your blood profile, we match you with dietary, behavioral, and therapeutic (coming soon) action plans 5. Repeat to see how fast you’re aging and identify factors in your life that affect your metabolite levels ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64281&key=user_uploads/822976/470ef64c-8221-48bd-96ac-d86b55556392) ### **Get the most out of your health data by testing more** **1 test/year** * Get the baseline values of 500+ of your blood metabolites * Compare your values to others and see if it’s within range * Get basic tips on how to improve your metabolite values \\ **3 tests/year** * Benefits of 1 test/year + * Integration with wearables * Understand how fast you’re aging (slower means better for your health) * See how fast your 500+ metabolites are changing compared to your own initial values (too much change might have implications for your health) * Identify general behaviors that affect your metabolite values and take action \\ **6 tests/year** * Benefits of 3 tests/year + * Integration with diet logging apps * Identify which of your own personal habits, diet, favorite products, supplements, medications and more impact your rate of aging, changes in your metabolite levels, and overall health * Get action plans that improve your metabolite values, such as dietary and behavioral recommendations \\ **9 tests/year** * Benefits of 6 tests/year + * Call with Stanford/Cornell scientist to go through results \\ **Custom tests/year** [Reach out to us](mailto:founders@iollo.com) if you want to test more than 9 times/year ### **Our ask** * [Pre-order](https://www.iollo.com/plans) – to participate in our early access program.

EUGIT Therapeutics – Next generation T cell based cancer immunotherapy,"We are a therapeutics company that is developing immune cell based therapy for treatment of breast, ovarian and prostate cancers. **Problem** Cancer remains an unsolved problem – it is expected that 1.8M new cancer cases and 0.6M cancer deaths will occur this year in the US (source CDC). Although development of immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells have shown remarkable clinical success, they work for only a few cancer types. In particular, they do not work for some of the most common types of cancers in women (breast and ovarian) and men (prostate). **Solution** Building upon the discoveries of the founders, EUGIT Therapeutics is engineering cancer-fighting immune cells known as the gamma delta T cells which overcome the limitations of existing cancer immunotherapies. **How it works** We take blood from healthy donors and isolate a specific type of immune cell called the gamma delta T cell and then endow them with cancer fighting activity via gene engineering. Our engineered T cells can be used off-the-shelf and ready for infusion into cancer patients. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64275&key=user_uploads/588526/a5ffcb03-a060-4080-9d9b-df2e92e6e72f) **Founders** [George Church](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-church-2b86301/) (Co-Founder and Scientific Advisor): George is a Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and leads Synthetic Biology at the Wyss Institute.

Aragorn AI: Sync millions of HR data with vendors,"Hello YC, We are Ed, Gladys and Eric, and we’re jazzed to launch [Aragorn AI](https://www.aragorn.ai/)! # **TL;DR:** [Aragorn](https://www.aragorn.ai/) helps enterprises sync their HR data with their vendor systems seamlessly. # **What is the problem and who is this for?** Most companies with employees between 500 and 10,000+ waste at least $400,000 and over 8,000 hours per year managing inefficient HRIS data integrations between their vendors. This is a very painful and arduous process for HR leaders and teams. Current attempts to simplify integrations have mostly failed because they are generally custom 1:1 solutions that do not scale, require enterprises to replace their existing HR systems, and are not specifically designed to handle HR data. HR leaders who adopt these integration platforms generally experience incremental costs and long implementation times (at least 3-months) per vendor. # **How it works** We’ve built a [solution](https://www.aragorn.ai/) where enterprises transfer their HRIS data to [Aragorn’s platform](https://www.aragorn.ai/) through encrypted means, map out attributes of the data to specific vendor formats programmed in [Aragorn](https://www.aragorn.ai/) and automatically share authorized data required by their vendors in a few hours. Our implementation time for HR leaders and organizations take days not months. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/694314/5d8bc48e-2c9e-4a66-84bb-3c74aa869f8d) # **Why we built** [**Aragorn AI**](https://www.aragorn.ai/) We grew up as siblings and worked at organizations that manually formatted big data and scheduled transfers to multiple vendors (donations, learning management, 401(k), health insurance, etc.).

Sunlight🔆- The Universal Card-on-File API,"Guy, Gil and I are thrilled to introduce [Sunlight](https://www.sunlightapi.com/) to help Fintechs automatically make their cards top-of-wallet immediately after they're issued! \\ \\ **Card-on-file is the digital commerce growth engine:** 82% of consumers use digital payments. Merchants, service providers and subscriptions-based businesses everywhere now offer their customers the ability to save a debit/credit card on file, so they can pay their bills on time, buy in one click, or earn rewards. And globally, 79% of consumers currently have saved a card on file or are open to doing so. \\ **The Problem:** In recent years, card-issuing-as-a-service has made it easy for any company to start their own card business, leading to an all-time high in the number of cards issued in 2021. For users, however, switching banks or opening a new credit card account comes with an additional hurdle: they need to update their payment info across multiple services. And on the other side of the equation, financial institutions that are issuing those cards are struggling to get their users to switch their spend from their old card to the new one. FIs have a very low conversion rate because they have no visibility and no control over the card-on-file updating process. **The Solution:** With our universal get-your-card-on-file API, FIs can offer their users at any point in their journey a quick and easy way to update their debit/credit card info everywhere they shop or pay online, without ever leaving their Apps. The Sunlight API works on every platform that has a card-on-file option (think Uber, Amazon, Netflix, DoorDash, Starbucks and so many more…), is as seamless as a Plaid connection, and always gets the card number right and CVV code on the first try! \\ **Our Ask** If you’re offering cards to your users and want to increase the usage of those cards to generate more revenue, email [founders@sunlightapi.com](https://mailto:founders@sunlightapi.com) to skip the waiting list and start using our API!\\ \\ Check out our website: [sunlightapi.com](https://www.sunlightapi.com/) 🚀☀️",Leo Chanea,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/28249bc497dcd3feb417fef1d8ca76af8717c82b.jpg,,26755

How are you supposed to close deals, especially with complex solutions, in this new world? This is compounded by the major lack of focus on partnering with customers to solve their problems. Sellers aren’t taking into account the needs of modern buyers and how they want to evaluate & purchase. They push customers through a _sales process_ vs guiding them through a _buyer journey_. 2. There’s no system to reinforce a collaborative, buyer-first approach – even if you had it all figured out! Nothing exists to map out the ideal process like there is in engineering (Github), Design (Figma), Product (Jira), etc. ## **💃 Solution** **Shared workspace between you and your buyer** in order to: a) drive collaboration & focus on buyer’s needs & expectations b) reinforce a repeatable motion that empowers leadership to scale & up-level their team Accord creates a dedicated workspace between buyer & seller with everything needed to build a strong partnership & increase win rates, deal velocity, and time-to-live: 1. Shared next steps & milestones to stay aligned together 2. Resource hub to avoid sorting through 100+ email threads for a doc 3. Stakeholder management to ensure the right ppl are involved at the right time 4. All integrated into CRMs like Salesforce for enhanced pipeline insights ## **🤔 Interested in reliably hitting revenue goals & building a repeatable GTM motion?** Shoot me a note at [ross@inaccord.com](mailto:ross@inaccord.com) or [sign up for a free trial](https://inaccord.com/free-trial) to check it out yourself!",Ross Rich,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/9187282ba47f6f8f1c44751c71dce0fead981ba2.jpg,,13058

Ciro 🚀 The GTM Platform for companies selling to SMB and Local businesses,"### **What’s the Problem?** If you run a business selling to an SMB vertical, you’ve probably found it **impossible to** **find rich data on the prospects in your market…** and that existing data solutions are rife with missing records, infrequent updates, and incorrect contact information. ### **What’s the Solution?** Ciro handles prospect list building so you don’t have to. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64232&key=user_uploads/928465/3ca9d271-95f9-45da-80ce-a085a8052544) Our solution combines hundreds of vertical-specific web crawlers that run every day, plus a data ingestion engine that joins dozens of public and proprietary data sources. Through these tools we provide our customers with a complete prospect database, plus vertical-specific “signals” to focus their outreach. Examples of these “signals” include: * Changes to a prospect’s **tech stack** (e.g. a doctor’s office uninstalls ZocDoc) * **New company formation** (e.g. a newly-registered construction license) * **Ownership changes** (e.g. change-of-control updates to company reporting docs)",Ross Geiger,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/19d4b31d53628ad9606383b7f863c5bde5fa3b3c.jpg,Otherimage_26671_1.jpg;,26671

Metriport - Plaid for Healthcare Data,"[**Metriport**](https://www.metriport.com/) **is Plaid for healthcare data. We help digital health companies access and manage patient health and medical data, through an **[**open-source**](https://github.com/metriport/metriport)** and universal API.** Through a single integration, our API enables modern health companies to get the comprehensive patient data they need from both HIEs and EHRs, as well as popular wearable devices. As a developer-first interoperability solution, Metriport is powering the next wave of innovative companies, accelerating a revolution in digital health. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64229&key=user_uploads/611194/fd5c5cef-fed7-43f8-ac03-ea270900ac3a) ### **Medical API** Serving as the world’s first open-source on-ramp to HIEs, our [Medical API](https://www.metriport.com/medical) enables companies to **seamlessly access comprehensive clinical histories for their patients**. Out-of-the-box, our solution provides access to medical records for \\~90% of individuals in the United States, leveraging our data-sharing partners, [CommonWell](https://www.commonwellalliance.org/) and [Carequality](https://carequality.org/). How it works is simple: you provide basic demographic information about your patient — name, date of birth, gender, and address — and we return their medical records in standardized formats, such as FHIR and C-CDA. If you’re a company looking to access patient medical records, [get in touch](https://www.metriport.com/contact-us) with us today to learn how our Medical API can solve your interoperability needs. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/611194/2202e08f-53e2-4499-9a50-04f526247122) ### **Devices API** Our [Devices API](https://www.metriport.com/devices) allows companies to gain **access to their users’ health data from various wearables, RPM devices, and mHealth apps**. For developers, building integrations to various consumer device providers is a huge pain, as it means wrangling different data formats, gaining access to the APIs in the first place, standardizing the data, and ultimately spending precious developer resources building out data pipelines. We solve this pain for you through our developer-first solution, which only requires a [few lines of code to get started with](https://docs.metriport.com/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart). Out of the box, our Devices API supports the following integrations: * Apple Health * Google Fit * Fitbit * Garmin * Oura * Whoop * Withings * Cronometer * Dexcom In addition to these integrations, you also get a pre-built [Connect widget](https://connect.metriport.com/?token=demo) that you can easily embed in your app, so your users can connect with their data sources. Plus, it’s [highly customizable](https://docs.metriport.com/devices-api/getting-started/connect-widget), so you can tweak it to fit your app’s UI. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/611194/f91e5ba2-aa5a-4f75-bd5c-23da07235216) ### **Why Open-Source?** We chose to build the world’s first open-source API for healthcare data, based on a number of advantages this offers: 1. **Immortal code:** with our open-source approach, you’re reliant on our code, not our business. If a closed-source company goes out of business tomorrow, its customers are out of luck. With open-source, you get unparalleled reliability, always maintaining the ability to self-host the source code on your own servers. This advantage can be especially critical in healthcare, where organizations need to ensure longterm stability and success for their patients. 2. **Security:** externally auditable source code makes Metriport more secure than our proprietary counterparts. Furthermore, closed-source vendors may not be as forthcoming about any security issues, leaving their customers vulnerable to potential security breaches. It goes without saying, but we’re also **HIPAA and SOC 2 Type 1 and Type 2 compliant**, thanks to our compliance monitoring partner, [Vanta](https://www.vanta.com/). ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64229&key=user_uploads/611194/79ffc29d-85cf-4f19-8a31-e27b46584f9a) 3. **Cost-effectiveness:** in addition to offering a SaaS cloud hosted solution, we also offer our customers the ability to self-host our code, meaning there’s no risk of vendor lock-in. This is ideal for companies looking for a long term vendor partnership, knowing they can always self-host down the road once they scale their business. 4. **Customizability:** our solutions allows customers to benefit from community contributions, and build their own custom features and integrations on top of our source code. ### **Getting Started** 🚀 [Metriport Developer Dashboard](https://dash.metriport.com/): this is where you can create your developer account, play around with Sandbox, and get your API key. 📚 [Our Developer Docs](https://docs.metriport.com/home/welcome), powered by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/): here you can follow our Quickstart Guides for both our [Medical API](https://docs.metriport.com/medical-api/getting-started/quickstart) and [Devices API](https://docs.metriport.com/devices-api/getting-started/connect-quickstart).

"Deskimo: On-demand workspaces, paid by the minute","With **Deskimo**, you can access 100+ professionally managed workspaces all across Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia without the need for a membership! ### **Problem** Work-from-home (WFH) is good for companies, as they can save fixed costs by reducing office leases, and it’s good for employees, as it increases flexibility and reduces commuting time. However, most homes are not designed for work, and personal circumstances add distractions, such as your partner being on a call or watching TV, or your toddlers and pets craving for your attention. ### **Solution** [Deskimo](http://www.deskimo.com/?utm_source=YC&utm_medium=bookface&utm_campaign=yclaunch) is complementing the WFH setup in South East Asia in a fully remote or hybrid future with near-home office options. Companies create an enterprise account on Deskimo and provide their employees a monthly budget that they can use at any of the listed workspaces on the app. As an employee, you can choose when to WFH and when to spend a few hours at a workspace to take important calls, attend a team or client meeting, or get some deep work done that requires full focus. Companies get one consolidated invoice per month and get billed only for the minutes used by their employees at any of the Deskimo workspaces. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/731649/583f07c5-1cbd-4205-86f2-0f33d9ceadb9) Deskimo is now live in Singapore, Hong Kong and Indonesia, and will expand to more countries soon. ### **Founders** We have previously co-founded Foodpanda (the “DoorDash” of Asia), now part of Delivery Hero ($DHER). Thereafter, we were the co-founders of HotelQuicky (the “Hotel Tonight” of Asia-Pacific), which turned into an OTA generating over $100M in annual GBV (exited in 2017). After HotelQuickly, Raphael then founded GoBeeBike, which was the leading bike sharing company in Hong Kong, before becoming the Head of Asia at Rocket Internet. Chris co-founded GuestReady, which is now the largest short-term rental management company in Europe and the Middle East. We have made a lot of learnings in PropTech, hospitality and on-demand marketplaces. We combine these learnings with our own experience in working remotely for the most part of the past 10 years and decided to launch Deskimo in a period where most companies are moving to a hybrid work model. ### **Asks** We would love to get your feedback, if you happen to be living in Asia and like to work from different places. If you have friends or family in our markets, tell them about Deskimo! You can help us by testing the app: ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/731649/1c9a5030-d2bb-4d0c-84d8-39025c78bd57) Please send us any unfiltered feedback to [founders@deskimo.com](mailto:founders@deskimo.com) Thank you 🙏, [Raphael](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelc/), [Christian](http://www.christianmischler.com)",Christian Mischler,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/d087f07261c180f6480c5eaefd4f8faf5cd33233.jpg,Otherimage_23955_1.jpg;Otherimage_23955_2.jpg;,23955
Whaly 🐳 BI platform to scale your business with data,"**The problem** After interviewing and working with 100+ companies, we understood that the “best” companies, that are “data driven” only have 20-30% of teams who have adopted data. Why? 1. ⏱ A data project is too long to setup and sometimes requires technical skills (\\~ 6 months average from ideation to implementation) 2. 💸 Costs are way too high 200K$ on average for a data project 3. 🧩 Data tools and BI are poorly connected to business teams workflows and tools (slack, spreadsheet, CRM, etc.) asking an additional effort to consume it 4. 😿 Data teams are too busy maintaining a stack instead of giving something more self-service tools to their users (business teams, investors, partners, clients, etc.) 5. 💩 In the end business teams tend to rebuild everything manually with spreadsheets or other tools instead of spending time analyzing the data So in short, on one hand data leaders spend 80% of their time maintaining a stack and on the other hand, people who need analysis and answers reinvent the wheel manually because they feel underserved. **Welcome to Whaly, the modern platform that helps everyone makes decision-based on data efficiently** So what is Whaly?

[**Codeball**](https://codeball.ai/) **is a code review AI which approves safe Pull Requests that a human would have approved.** We _hate_ waiting for reviews. This started off as scratching our own itch in answering \""How predictable are programmers?\"" Very predictable, turned out to be the answer. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/586182/2a1fd4ab-7a26-4a54-a9cd-a7ccc394aaed) ## **🧠 How** Codeball is trained on over 1M Pull Requests, so it has seen tons of failure (shitty code) and success (decent code) patterns, making it really good at telling the difference. You can play with it at [codeball.ai](https://codeball.ai) where you can do \""historical\"" tests on GitHub repos to see what Codeball would have done. Using AI for mundane reviews saves a bunch of time, but the part that's really cool is that once you stop rubber stamping every single PR, you pay more attention to the tricky ones. ## **👉 Getting started** ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/586182/956431aa-6b25-45dc-b343-fb9905cced54) You can add Codeball to your repository as a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/sturdy-dev/codeball-action/) (takes like 2 minutes). _Try for free!_ ## **💻 What are developers saying?** Codeball is currently used by over 100 open-source repositories, including HUGE communities like gogs, kratos, and emqx! “This is incredible, don’t forget to charge us!” – CEO “I love it, developers are now trying to ‘cheat’ the system by creating smaller PRs, just like I’ve been telling them to!” – Senior Software Engineer Also a bunch more in the [Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31533180) that made front page recently.",Gustav Westling,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/244d49dacc15bf0e90adf2d9dd3acde5044873b1.jpg,Otherimage_23276_1.jpg;Otherimage_23276_2.jpg;,23276

Albi - the super app for property insurance damage repair contractors,"**The problem:** Technology in the damage repair space (think 🌪 🔥 💦 🏠 😢 ) is very limited (FileMaker pro apps and Microsoft Access databases 🙄). This is hindering damage repair contractors’ ability to scale their businesses. **The solution:** An all-in-one CRM, project management, field documentation, scheduling, BI, marketing automation, communication, HR management, and communication, designed specifically for damage repair contractors. This helps empower contractors with tools to better document their jobs (no more digital cameras, paper napkin sketches, redundant data entry), impress their customers (automated texts, emails, and surveys), reduce claims friction (arguments between contractor and insurance company), and allows them to scale faster! ![Restoration Software](https://albiware.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Albi_Homepage-1-2048x1536-1.png) **How we came up with this:** One of our founders (Alex) grew a restoration company from his dad’s garage to over 8 figures. He painfully attempted to do so utilizing the clunky technology on the market, and was convinced there had to be a better way. He partnered with Shamoil, a long-time friend and senior software engineer at a Med Tech startup, and together they built Albi! ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/828687/0b77665b-8613-4a4a-8b1f-399b96a869ac) \\ \\ **Asks:** If you know anyone we could synergize with, we’d love to talk!

🚀 Zoltar Labs - Smart Contract Testing Made Faster ⚡️,"Hey Fam 👋 Jensen and James from [@Zoltar Labs](https://ycombinator.com/companies/zoltar-labs) here! Zoltar is the easiest way for Web3 / smart contract developers to spin up test environments and accelerate testing velocity.⚡️ --- **What is Zoltar 💡** Zoltar is a controlled test environment where anyone on the team can configure and run simulations. Developers deploy smart contracts to a private instance of an EVM-compatible blockchain, where collaborators can perform tests against different states or integrate frontend with deployed contracts. This enables the following for smart contract development today: * **Incremental updates:** CI integration with Zoltar sandboxes means that every small change results in an automatic deployment to our test environment instead of clunky deployments to public testnets or mainnet * **Teamwide visibility:** Developers can simply launch their own sandbox with the environment setup they have locally, and share these states in the form of sandboxes with their teammates ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/849908/93b09747-c50d-4933-8b5f-c12671b35794) --- **Who is This For 👶** Web3 teams (e.g. smart contract engineers, frontend engineers, PMs, etc) that want a better testing experience than public testnets. No more wasting time on:  * ✍️ Writing scripts to share test states among developers * 💰 Obtaining test tokens from faucets * 😩 Clunky frontend integration experience with testnets * 🚫 Worrying about test code being accessible on public testnets --- **Why We Built This 😷** One of the most painful things about smart contract testing is not being able to share test environment states or integrate with deployed smart contracts easily. This stems from not having control over the blockchain testing environment. Existing tools were all built for single-developer utility, and all the test environments sit locally on your machine.  For blockchain companies, sharing environment states today involves additional scripting and mocking of protocols, which slows down velocity. Alternatively, testing directly on a public testnet involves manual sharing of private keys, which poses security risks. --- **We’d Love to Hear From You** 🤝 Email us at [jensen@zoltarlabs.com](https://mailto:jensen@zoltarlabs.com) or [james@zoltarlabs.com](https://mailto:james@zoltarlabs.com) if… * You are a blockchain developer and have experienced pain points with the current testing workflow * You are part of a Web3 team and want a more streamlined smart contract development experience ### --- **Sign up for our beta** [**here**](https://yjmqezl7c95.typeform.com/to/HXkQK50e) **today!**",Jensen Kuo,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/0799a75c6f296b1fa6fa404afaae84abc6b3de26.jpg,Otherimage_26876_1.jpg;,26876

"Equipt Health - Home medical equipment, prescribed online and delivered 📦","**The Opportunity** Healthcare companies are delivering increasingly complex care in the home. Working at digital health startups like Counsyl, Truepill, Medallion, and Q Bio, we’ve seen the difference that infrastructure tools for laboratory, pharmacy, telemedicine networks, and imaging can make in providing medically actionable insights and delivering impactful care. The missing piece of this stack is home medical equipment (like CPAP machines, blood glucose monitors, oxygen concentrators, breast pumps, and more). **How It Works** Equipt Health makes it easy for any company to offer prescription medical devices to patients. We handle the whole process: the inventory, the packaging, the logistics, the clinical (via our provider network) and technical support, and the return of data from connected devices. We're starting with the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea. **Helio Sleep Powered by Equipt Health** We created [Helio Sleep](https://www.heliosleep.com/) to give users a better way to understand and improve their health through sleep tests, best-in-class treatment devices, and access to board-certified physicians. 24M Americans are currently undiagnosed for sleep apnea, leaving them not only tired but also at risk for serious health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure.

🚀 Caddie - Schedule Meetings & Qualify Inbound Leads,"# Book More Demos from Your Website [Watch a Demo](https://youtu.be/72TtCntEkac) ### 😄 **About Us** → Our Customers Were Pissed Off, So We Did Something About It In our past life, Marshall and I led sales and marketing teams. More recently, we asked ourselves: * Why does conversion in B2B websites suck (from Visitor to a Demo Booked)? * Why do we keep hearing complains that customer just “want a F\\*&!ng demo!”? We explored solutions to fix this and Caddie hit us in the face. ### **🤬** Problem → Too Much Friction to Request a Demo * **Friction is Killing Leads** → 83% of interested buyers never make it to a demo because there are too many steps to get a demo. * **Speed Matters →** 74% of buyers purchase from the first company they see a demo from. * **Have SDRs do Qualification Calls? →** Adding an SDR qualification step leads to 30% drop-off in pipeline. In addition, they are expensive and hard to hire. ## 🚀 Solution → Make It Easy to Schedule & Qualify * Build a personalized **demo** **scheduling experience.** * **Qualify inbound** leads by asking simple questions. * Using logic and point scoring, **route** to the right Account Exec. * Finally, allow qualified prospects to **schedule a demo** on the spot. Try a demo by going to [trycaddie.com](http://trycaddie.com) **Using Calendly? →** We allow you to qualify prospects before bad leads jam your calendar. In addition, we shorten your contact form by getting key insights from a database of 200M+ records so you don’t need to ask for “First Name”, “Company”, “# of employees”. The result is 50%+ more qualified leads than with Calendly. ## 💰 The Impact → 2X More Demos, Faster Deal Speed, No Need for SDRs to Qualify Manually. * Book 2X more demos by removing friction. * Improve speed from lead to opportunity by 50% by cutting steps. * Have SDRs qualifying leads? → Cut $100,000s in costs.",Marshall Johnston,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/9374ca47cf301e53d054f859f01e92a10b364347.jpg,,27154

We’re Colin & Lyn from [webapp.io](http://webapp.io). We’re helping webapp developers make new copies of their stack in seconds using memory snapshots. You can think of a cloud-agnostic, full-stack version of the branch deployments you’d get from Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, or Render - even if you’re using a regular cloud provider instead of a PaaS. [Webapp.io](http://Webapp.io) lets you create full-stack environments for every pull request in seconds. We’ve built a custom hypervisor that watches which files are used in which build steps, and skips repetitive actions like starting microservices, seeding databases, or building images. It came out of our own frustrations from having to often skip end-to-end testing for commits just for the sake of developer velocity. A typo fix on a landing page shouldn’t take 15+ minutes to spin up a fresh environment for some Cypress tests! ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64193&key=user_uploads/364633/abdf8553-ec80-4b7a-9582-62e95d43cbc7) [Webapp.io](http://Webapp.io) works with any Linux-based stack, and the configuration works like a Dockerfile for VMs so that you can get started without having to talk to support. ![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64193&key=user_uploads/364633/4e3f5b2c-3215-41ef-851d-5e46a72727d7) Once you’ve installed our app on your GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket profile, you can push files called Layerfile in the syntax above, and we’ll automatically discover them and build your environments. [Webapp.io](http://Webapp.io) builds new VMs by re-using memory snapshots of your earlier builds. That means you can get a fresh copy of your database, microservices, and backend in seconds for a frontend change 10x faster than a production cloud provider or traditional CI. Our free tier is generous and we’re happy to set up a shared slack channel to help prospective users get set up.

🎗🐎 Chariot (S22) - payment button for nonprofits to accept $ from Donor Advised Funds,"![uploaded image](/media/?type=post&id=64138&key=user_uploads/1001037/29f02afe-6ad6-4bbb-b8d6-f844e711ec04) Charities add our “Pay with DAF” widget to their payment page. Donors click the button, log in to their DAF account, and make a payment – as easy as Paypal. ### **What is a Donor Advised Fund?** A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a **specialized financial account used for the purpose of charitable giving**. It allows donors to make a charitable contribution, receive an immediate tax deduction, and then recommend grants (that become donations) to 501(c) charities over time. Once considered a tool primarily for the wealthy, DAFs have started gaining mainstream adoption. With over 1.3 million accounts, growing at 37% a year, **DAFs are now the fastest growing vehicle in all of philanthropy.** ### **Problem:** 1. **🛑 Can’t give with your DAF on fundraisers, campaigns, or a nonprofit’s website.** Your friend sends you a link to donate to their marathon campaign. Even though you have money in your DAF that can only go to charity you can’t use these DAF funds to donate.  2. **💵 DAF money is sitting idle and not going to charity.** In 2021, $234 Billion sat in DAF accounts ready to be donated.  3. **🤔 Charities can’t easily connect with their DAF donors:** Blank checks come in from many different DAFs without clarity on who it’s coming from 4. **😒 Charities have unnecessary back office DAF work.** When DAF donations are received, nonprofits have to manually input these donations into their CRMs. # **Solution:** 1. **Enable donors to give at fundraisers** and campaigns with their DAFs **in 3 simple clicks**  2. **Unlock more DAF donations, larger donations** (DAF donors are, on average, 30% more generous), and multiply nonprofit funds with Chariot's recurring donation option. 3. **Connect with your DAF donors:** By providing nonprofits with up-to-date donor contact information (if donor permits), they can now foster direct connections with their biggest DAF supporters. 4. **Track your DAF donations**: Chariot integrates with a nonprofit’s donation form provider and CRM so they can track the status of their DAF donations automatically. Monitor those donations as they are initiated, approved, and sent out. # **Ask** We are planning on launching this fall! **Have a relationship with a nonprofit you think we can help?

As mRNA technology matures, it becomes imperative that these issues are solved so we can fully explore mRNA's endless possibilities as a therapeutic. ### **Context:** Many of you likely had mRNA vaccines to protect against COVID-19 - but how many of you know that mRNAs are being developed into other cutting edge, life-saving therapeutics? It is very likely that a large portion of the future treatments that you and I take for a number of ailments will be in the form of mRNA-based therapeutics. The range of diseases that mRNA promises to treat include heart disease, liver dysfunction, solid tumors, blood cancers, and several genetic disorders. ### **Problem:** For therapeutic applications, the quality of the mRNA needs to be extremely high compared to mRNA used for vaccines. For example, one of the well-known contaminants, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is present in trace amounts alongside mRNA but it does no harm at the fractional doses in mRNA vaccine (micrograms). However, higher and repeat dosage (milligrams) of the same, as applied to other mRNA applications and treatments, can potentially have devastating consequences if we do not remove the dsRNA first. Currently, Pharma companies spend millions of dollars to remove dsRNA by employing multiple chromatography purification systems. Unfortunately, these processes add to the cost of production of single chromatography purifications and lead to substantial wastage of mRNA, thereby resulting in poor yields - the latter adding even more to the costs of production. ### **Solution:** Cisterna uses proprietary technologies to either remove a contaminant at its source or replace the source itself. To remove dsRNA, we use ribozymes (molecular scissors) to precisely cut the mRNA at its 3’ end. This assures not only 3’ homogeneity, but also eliminates dsRNA, which are primarily produced due to self-templated additions at the 3’ ends. Utilizing a PCR-like system to amplify the DNA template in large quantities eliminates the requirement for plasmid enrichment in bacteria, the prime source of endotoxin contamination. Additionally, doing away with plasmids completely means a further reduction in extraneous dsRNA arising from cryptic promoter sequences in the undigested non-template strand. These are just a few examples of Cisterna’s powerful technologies being used to achieve our goal of 10x higher quality mRNA for therapeutic application. ### **Founder:** Hari Bhaskaran completed his Ph.D. at UT-Austin under the mentorship of Dr. Rick Russell; his thesis was published in the prestigious journal Nature. He has held positions of increasing responsibilities in both academia and industry. His roles have led him to produce innovative mRNA construct designs for therapeutics, create scale-up techniques for manufacturing and improve process development for purifications and analytics. He is the author of several publications and industry patents. ### **Asks:** If you’d like to more about Cisterna’s high-quality mRNA, please feel free to reach out to [founders@cisternabx.com](mailto:founders@cisternabx.com)",Hari Bhaskaran,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/c702b50cf2197208b8ba999e857c4d6c8ebea2d5.jpg,,26554

Payload — A Developer-First Content Management System,"Hey YC, James, Dan, and Elliot here. We’re three full-stack TypeScript devs that got tired of feeling like second-class citizens when it comes to content management systems—so we built Payload. [**Payload**](https://payloadcms.com) is a truly dev-first, headless content management system aimed sharply at giving engineers the best development experience possible in a noisy ecosystem of tools that often disregard the importance of quality, clean, extensible code. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/969037/ca9a0712-e89c-4aaa-b63b-7b325f8ffbbb) ### The Problem To developers, “content management system” is a swear word. * Devs want to build cutting-edge products that are structured effectively to deliver elegant solutions to their business needs. * Modern teams want to write code in modern languages like TypeScript and React, but most CMS are built with legacy tech and have lasted long past their shelf life. * You will often hit roadblocks with other CMS, and many SaaS options “black-box” functionality away, meaning developers can never truly own their own code. * Devs often undervalue the power that a good CMS _could_ represent. Even web and native apps generally need to manage “content”, like orders, requests, users, profiles, and more—but often, developers roll their own systems for these apps. Time is wasted and the wheel is reinvented from scratch every time. Building a project that needs a CMS shouldn’t be a dreaded task for modern developers. ### Payload is... **A CMS that is obsessed with giving engineers the best developer experience possible to build out APIs and admin UI.** It catapults developers' efficiency and value by delivering an extensible REST and GraphQL API as well as a beautiful React admin panel for non-technical users to manage content—all in TypeScript. From docs to design, it's staunchly code-first, but uncompromising in admin experience. Developers finally have a tool to deliver their admins with a CMS that is beautiful, minimal, extensible, and usable. It can power the backend for websites of all sizes, ecommerce, SaaS, native apps, and more. **Tech specs:** * Completely open-source * [Fully self-hosted](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) * [GraphQL](https://payloadcms.com/docs/graphql/overview), [REST](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rest-api/overview), and [Local](https://payloadcms.com/docs/local-api/overview) APIs * [Customizable ReactJS Admin](https://payloadcms.com/docs/admin/overview) * [Extensible authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview) * [Local file storage & upload](https://payloadcms.com/docs/upload/overview) * [Field-based localization](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/localization) * [Block-based layout builder](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/blocks) * [Extensible SlateJS rich text editor](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/rich-text) * [Array field type](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/array) * [Field conditional logic](https://payloadcms.com/docs/fields/overview#conditional-logic) * Extremely granular [Access control](https://payloadcms.com/docs/access-control/overview) * [Document and field-level hooks](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/overview) for every action Payload provides * Built with Typescript & very Typescript-friendly * Highly secure thanks to HTTP-only cookies, CSRF protection, and more ### What customers say * \""This product is a developer's dream come true in the world of CMS.\"" - Developer, NYC, USA - 12 Oct 2021 * \""CMS used to be something dreadful, now it's starting to feel right.\"" - Developer, London, UK - 31 Mar 2021 * “Started looking into headless CMS options... Payload was a clear winner.” - Developer, Berlin, Germany - 24 June 2021 ### Who we are We're three full-stack engineers that have built digital projects with existing CMS for over a decade—including enterprise websites for big names like Klarna. We knew what we wanted, but also intimately knew it didn't exist—so we built it. ### Ask for YC **Have a GitHub account? Stop by our repo and** [**give us a star**](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload)**!** If you're building a digital product that needs to manage content, give Payload a shot by running **npx create-payload-app**.

Paces - Analytics for Profitable Green Infrastructure,"### **The Problem** We need to build trillions worth of clean energy and transport infrastructure to have any chance of a sub 1.5 degree world. Right now, it is really hard to build these projects. Nimbyism, zoning and grid capacity issues mean that only 1 in 5 green infrastructure projects are actually built, costing $18 Billion in canceled US projects per year. It's a mess. ### **The Solution** Paces enables more green infrastructure like solar and hydrogen to be built profitably, accelerating a climate positive built environment. We collect zoning, permitting, grid and environmental data and calculate at the parcel level and help green infrastructure project developers and investors understand if the project makes sense for a particular parcel. If it does we also calculate the project’s profitability versus another climate positive use case. ### **About Us** We have built and sold world-class data and software solutions across industries, from fintech to AI at Fortune500 companies like Facebook AI and FactSet. After seeing how data transformed these industries, we thought it was wild that green infrastructure does not have the same tools. We have also had an exit to Google as employee 1 at an AI startup, and lead AI efficiency at Facebook.

Kamion: Uber for Trucks for the Turkish Market,"_tl;dr_ - [Kamion](https://kamion.co/) connects shippers with truckers in the B2B space in Turkey. \\ **the Problem:** Turkey is MENA’s largest economy, with \\~850,000 independent truckers and a logistics TAM of 73 Billion USD. However, in its current state, freight forwarding for trucking faces two main challenges: 1. _1) Operational Inefficiency —_ There are many phone calls, emails, and f2f conversations in booking trucks for your loads. 2. _2) Fragmented Market —_ The top 10 players in trucking account for around 5-6% of the total market size. SME fleets (5-10 trucks) run 90-95% of the market. \\ **the Solution:**\\ \\ We act as the main point of contact for the shippers and reduce complexity for them. We also utilize technology to do more with fewer people and collect data. \\ **Why we built Kamion:**\\ \\ Berkay started working at an early age and spent a lot of time in the logistics, procurement, and warehousing departments.

Relay 💨 Peer support to overcome addiction,"# **Problem** **Most people struggle alone for years** And it makes it nearly impossible to see improvement. The person might turn to friends and family, but they overreact or aren’t able to effectively support because they can’t relate. On top of that, professional help or in-person groups can be expensive, and it takes a lot of courage to get there. **Even those attending in-person groups (e.g. AA) feel isolated between weekly meetings** For the minority who do join a group-based program, meetings are usually held only once a week — leaving participants largely on their own the other six days of the week. # **Solution** Relay helps users… * Get matched into a team of 5-8 peers * Experience meaningful connection and avoid slipping back into isolation * Find shame-free accountability * Train emotional awareness and understand patterns/triggers * Throw a red flag (i.e. SOS) with a single tap to let their team know they need help when feeling vulnerable Since launching in September 2021, 79% of our users have reported seeing improvement within their first month of using the app. ## **Why we’re tackling this** Members on our team have struggled personally with addiction and saw first-hand the power that comes from forming an effective team of peers for connection and accountability.

Bend ⚡ 1-click Carbon Accounting,"At Bend, we help companies develop an **affordable**, **automated**, and **credible** path to net zero using your spend data. And we help fintech companies **embed** sustainability into b2b tools. ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/8725/de981465-da6b-4888-b0cd-3df01f8cdce6) Thomas and I found our way to this project via our background in fintech. Prior to Bend, we worked together at Abacus (W14), a real time expense management company that I cofounded in 2014, serving small businesses. At Abacus, we noticed a pattern: finance teams are increasingly paying attention to the climate impact of their purchase decisions, from travel policies, to cloud hosting, and beyond. And better tooling and data is needed to drive pragmatic, effective climate action. ### **From zero to net zero in 5 minutes** Here’s how Bend works: * Bend converts spend data into CO2e data. * For example: imagine a $1,000 bill from Atlassian. Bend aggregates corporate emissions disclosures; we know that for every $1,000 spent with Atlassian, there’s a 30.2 kg footprint. * For long-tail merchants, we have merchant category fallbacks, so you’re always guaranteed 100% coverage (e.g. for Starbucks, we use the Starbucks factor, for a mom-and-pop coffee shop, we use a benchmark ‘coffee shop’ factor). * Our methodology is developed and vetted by climate science PhDs (degrees from MIT, Columbia, etc.), and our team has years of fintech experience (Abacus, Emburse, Google, Venmo). * Once armed with a complete picture of your emissions, you can choose a course of action — you might consider switching to lower-carbon-intensity vendors, offsetting your remaining emissions, and then **closing sales as a sustainable business** (we can help!). ![uploaded image](/media/?key=user_uploads/8725/339c2757-2d8e-4721-9bdc-d3b996b98c44) ### **Why now** * Companies (e.g. Salesforce, Apple, Walmart) now require their suppliers to measure emissions and set reductions targets. Bend can help you sell to these customers. * The SEC is expected to roll out new climate data disclosure requirements this year, applying to public companies, with downstream impacts. * Your company has a surprising amount of leverage to accelerate decarbonization. It’s a great thing to be a part of, and has positive brand benefits for your startup. ### **Our ask** Try Bend out!

Boostly (S22): Text Marketing & Feedback on Autopilot for Restaurants,"**We provide an automated text marketing and feedback system to restaurants that works seamlessly with their point of sale and online ordering systems.** Our restaurant partners typically get $10-$15 back for every dollar that they spend with us. We founded Boostly in 10/2017 and went through a few pivots before we landed on this current concept that we’ve grown to roughly $1M in annual revenue through outbound sales. We’re just getting warmed up and plan to grow our marketing channels during YC. ## **Problems** * Restaurants live or die based on their ability to get their customers ordering regularly, but over 60% of a restaurant's customer base never make it in for a 2nd visit. * Customer data is notoriously hard for restaurant owners to access because it’s in several different systems with various accessibility challenges. * Restaurant owners are strapped for time and often lack any marketing know-how. * Most restaurant marketing lacks good tracking to know exactly how it’s working. ## **Our Solution** * We aggregate customer data from several data sources for the restaurant & get customers to opt in to receive texts from the store. * We put text marketing on autopilot with weekly offers, birthday deals, & relevant reminders. * While the customer eats, we solicit feedback via a 2 click survey and help to connect the restaurant with the guest if there was an issue or generate a 5 star review on Google. * We track the restaurant’s ROI across all of their sales channels (online, over the phone, or in-store).",Shane Murphy,https://bookface-images.s3.amazonaws.com/avatars/d0439bd5e7f78be8e3d26837718fa80b0caf5552.jpg,,26742
